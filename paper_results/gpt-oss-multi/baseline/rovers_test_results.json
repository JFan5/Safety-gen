Constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously.\nWe need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We must ensure all preconditions satisfied. We can choose any plan that works.\nWe need to consider the actions available: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.\nWe have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint8 initially, rover1 at waypoint11. They have stores: rover0store, rover1store. They are equipped for soil analysis, imaging, etc. Rover1 also equipped for rock analysis.\nWe need to collect soil samples at waypoints 2,8,4.

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective2 colour and low_res. We have two rovers, each with store, cameras. Cameras support modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res; camera1 supports high_res, low_res; camera2 supports colour, high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective0. So to take image for objective2, we need a camera that supports colour or low_res? We need to take image for objective2 with colour and low_res. But only camera1 supports low_res. camera0 supports colour. camera2 supports colour. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective0? Wait calibration target is camera0 objective0. So camera0 can only be calibrated for objective0. But we need to take image for objective2. The action take_image requires calibrated camera i for rover r. So we need to calibrate camera for objective2. But calibration_target only defined for camera0 and camera2 for objective0, camera1 for objective1. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r). So camera must be calibrated for that rover. Calibration target is camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. So maybe we can take image for objective2 with any camera that supports the mode? Wait the action take_image requires (calibrated ?i ?r) and (supports ?i ?m). So camera must be calibrated for that rover, but not necessarily for the objective. The calibration target is just a property of camera. But the calibration target is used in calibrate action: precondition includes (calibration_target ?i ?t). So to calibrate camera i for rover r, we need to specify a target objective t. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, camera1 for objective1, camera2 for objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The action take_image doesn't require that the objective matches the calibration target. It only requires that the camera is calibrated for that rover. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, then take image for objective2 with camera0. That seems allowed. So we",

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint8, 11, 0, 6; communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. Also constraint: always (not (at rover1 waypoint8)). So rover1 must never be at waypoint8. We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint3 initially, rover1 at waypoint9. We have visible relations, can_traverse edges. We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 8, 11, 0, 6. They are at those waypoints initially: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Wait list: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Also at_rock_sample at 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at 8, 11, 0, 6. We have store for each rover. They start empty. We need to sample soil at each waypoint, then communicate soil data to lander general at waypoint2. The lander is at waypoint2. We need to have rover at waypoint2 to communicate. But we have to ensure that rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. But rover0 can traverse to waypoint8? Let's check can_traverse edges: rover0 can traverse to waypoint8 from 3, and from 8 to 4, 10. Also from 3 to 9, 11. So to reach waypoint8, rover0 must go from 3 to 8. That's allowed. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. For other waypoints 0,6,11, we can use rover0 or rover1. But we must ensure rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can avoid that.\nGoal also requires communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. We need to take images at those objectives. We have cameras on rovers: camera0,1,2 on rover0; camera3 on rover1. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective2, camera2 -> objective2, camera3 -> objective1.
