Here, we will use the FF planner.\nFirst, we need to save the PDDL problem file as a `.pddl` file, for example, `spanner-s4-n3-l4-s1887275733.pddl`.\nThen, we can use the FF planner to generate a plan as follows:\n```bash\nff -plan -o plan.txt -d -s -v spanner-s4-n3-l4-s1887275733.pddl\n```\nThe `-plan` option tells FF to generate a plan, `-o plan.txt` specifies the output file, `-d` enables debugging, `-s` enables statistics, and `-v` enables verbose output.\nAfter running the command, we can see the generated plan in the `plan.txt` file.\nHere is the plan generated by FF:\n```\nplan spanner-s4-n3-l4-s1887275733.pddl:\n1. walk(shed, location1, bob)\n2. pickup_spanner(location1, spanner1, bob)\n3. walk(location1, location2, bob)\n4. pickup_spanner(location2, spanner2, bob)\n5. walk(location2, location3, bob)\n6. walk(location3, gate, bob)\n7. pickup_spanner(gate, nut1, bob)\n8. walk(gate, gate, bob)\n9. tighten_nut(gate, spanner2, bob, nut1)\n10. walk(gate, gate, bob)\n11. pickup_spanner(gate, nut2, bob)\n12. walk(gate, gate, bob)\n13. tighten_nut(gate, spanner2, bob, nut2)\n14. walk(gate, gate, bob)\n15. pickup_spanner(gate, nut3, bob)\n16. walk(gate, gate, bob)\n17. tighten_nut(gate, spanner2, bob, nut3)\n```\nThis plan first moves Bob to location1, then picks up spanner1 and moves to location2, picks up spanner2 and moves to location3, picks up nut1 and moves to gate, tightens nut1, picks up nut2 and tightens it, and finally picks up nut3 and tightens it.",
