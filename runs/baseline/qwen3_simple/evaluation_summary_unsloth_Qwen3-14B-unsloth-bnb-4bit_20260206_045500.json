Move robot1 from room2 to room4 to pick up ball2**\n- **Action:** `move robot1 room2 room4`\n- **Effect:** Robot is now in `room4`.\n#### **2. Pick up ball2 using rgripper1**\n- **Action:** `pick robot1 ball2 room4 rgripper1`\n- **Effect:** Robot now carries `ball2` in `rgripper1`.\n#### **3. Move robot1 from room4 to room2**\n- **Action:** `move robot1 room4 room2`\n- **Effect:** Robot is now in `room2`.\n#### **4. Drop ball2 in room2**\n- **Action:** `drop robot1 ball2 room2 rgripper1`\n- **Effect:** `ball2` is now in `room2`.\n---\n### **5. Move robot1 from room2 to room3 to pick up ball3**\n- **Action:** `move robot1 room2 room3`\n- **Effect:** Robot is now in `room3`.\n#### **6.
