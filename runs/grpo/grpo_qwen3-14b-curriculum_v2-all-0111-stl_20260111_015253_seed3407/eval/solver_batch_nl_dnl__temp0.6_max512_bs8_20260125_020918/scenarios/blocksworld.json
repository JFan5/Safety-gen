Use the exact syntax shown when creating plans.\n\n**pickup** - Pick up a block from the table\n  When: the block is clear (nothing on top), it is on the table, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the block; the block is no longer on the table or clear; the arm is no longer empty\n  Syntax: (pickup <ob>)\n\n**putdown** - Put the held block down on the table\n  When: the arm is holding a block\n  Result: the block is on the table and clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (putdown <ob>)\n\n**stack** - Place the held block on top of another block\n  When: the arm is holding a block, and the target block is clear\n  Result: the held block is on the target block and becomes clear; the target block is no longer clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (stack <ob> <underob>)\n\n**unstack** - Pick up a block from the top of another block\n  When: a block is on another block, the top block is clear, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the top block; the bottom block becomes clear; the top block is no longer on the bottom block\n  Syntax: (unstack <ob> <underob>)\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: blocksworld\n\n## Objects\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4\n\n## Initial State\n- The robot arm is empty.\n- Block b1 is on block b4.\n- Block b2 is on the table.\n- Block b3 is on block b1.\n- Block b4 is on the table.\n- Block b2 is clear (nothing on top).\n- Block b3 is clear (nothing on top).\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Block b1 is on block b2.\n  - Block b2 is on block b3.\n  - Block b3 is on the table.\n  - Block b4 is on the table.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"block b2 is on block b3\" becomes true, \"block b1 is on block b2\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"

Use the exact syntax shown when creating plans.\n\n**pickup** - Pick up a block from the table\n  When: the block is clear (nothing on top), it is on the table, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the block; the block is no longer on the table or clear; the arm is no longer empty\n  Syntax: (pickup <ob>)\n\n**putdown** - Put the held block down on the table\n  When: the arm is holding a block\n  Result: the block is on the table and clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (putdown <ob>)\n\n**stack** - Place the held block on top of another block\n  When: the arm is holding a block, and the target block is clear\n  Result: the held block is on the target block and becomes clear; the target block is no longer clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (stack <ob> <underob>)\n\n**unstack** - Pick up a block from the top of another block\n  When: a block is on another block, the top block is clear, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the top block; the bottom block becomes clear; the top block is no longer on the bottom block\n  Syntax: (unstack <ob> <underob>)\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: blocksworld\n\n## Objects\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6\n\n## Initial State\n- The robot arm is empty.\n- Block b1 is on the table.\n- Block b2 is on block b5.\n- Block b3 is on the table.\n- Block b4 is on block b2.\n- Block b5 is on block b6.\n- Block b6 is on block b3.\n- Block b1 is clear (nothing on top).\n- Block b4 is clear (nothing on top).\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Block b1 is on block b6.\n  - Block b2 is on the table.\n  - Block b3 is on block b1.\n  - Block b4 is on the table.\n  - Block b5 is on the table.\n  - Block b6 is on the table.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"block b2 is on the table\" becomes true, \"block b1 is on block b6\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"

      "prompt": "You are a planning expert. Solve the following problem based on the provided domain.\n\nDOMAIN:\n## Domain Overview\n\nThis domain involves a robot arm manipulating blocks on a table. The arm can hold one block at a time. Blocks can be stacked on top of each other, and the goal is typically to rearrange blocks into a desired configuration.\n\n## Actions\n\nThe following actions are available. Use the exact syntax shown when creating plans.\n\n**pickup** - Pick up a block from the table\n  When: the block is clear (nothing on top), it is on the table, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the block; the block is no longer on the table or clear; the arm is no longer empty\n  Syntax: (pickup <ob>)\n\n**putdown** - Put the held block down on the table\n  When: the arm is holding a block\n  Result: the block is on the table and clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (putdown <ob>)\n\n**stack** - Place the held block on top of another block\n  When: the arm is holding a block, and the target block is clear\n  Result: the held block is on the target block and becomes clear; the target block is no longer clear; the arm becomes empty\n  Syntax: (stack <ob> <underob>)\n\n**unstack** - Pick up a block from the top of another block\n  When: a block is on another block, the top block is clear, and the arm is empty\n  Result: the arm holds the top block; the bottom block becomes clear; the top block is no longer on the bottom block\n  Syntax: (unstack <ob> <underob>)\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: blocksworld\n\n## Objects\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6\n\n## Initial State\n- The robot arm is empty.\n- Block b1 is on block b5.\n- Block b2 is on the table.\n- Block b3 is on block b1.\n- Block b4 is on block b6.\n- Block b5 is on block b4.\n- Block b6 is on the table.\n- Block b2 is clear (nothing on top).\n- Block b3 is clear (nothing on top).\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Block b1 is on block b6.\n  - Block b3 is on block b2.\n  - Block b5 is on block b3.\n  - Block b6 is on block b4.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"block b3 is on block b2\" becomes true, \"block b1 is on block b6\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"
