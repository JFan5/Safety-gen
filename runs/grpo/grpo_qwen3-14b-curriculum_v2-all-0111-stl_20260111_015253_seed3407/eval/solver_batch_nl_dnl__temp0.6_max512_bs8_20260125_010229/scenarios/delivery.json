After moving, the truck is at the destination cell, no longer at the origin cell, and the origin cell is recorded as the truck's last visited cell.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: delivery\n\n## Objects\nCell: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3, c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2, c_2_3, c_3_0, c_3_1, c_3_2, c_3_3\nPackage: p1, p2\nTruck: t1\n\n## Initial State\n- Cell c_0_2 is adjacent to cell c_0_1.\n- Cell c_1_2 is adjacent to cell c_1_1.\n- Cell c_2_0 is adjacent to cell c_3_0.\n- Cell c_2_2 is adjacent to cell c_1_2.\n- Cell c_0_0 is adjacent to cell c_1_0.\n- Cell c_2_2 is adjacent to cell c_3_2.\n- Cell c_2_2 is adjacent to cell c_2_3.\n- Cell c_3_0 is adjacent to cell c_2_0.\n- Cell c_0_2 is adjacent to cell c_0_3.\n- Cell c_2_3 is adjacent to cell c_2_2.\n- Cell c_3_1 is adjacent to cell c_3_2.\n- Cell c_1_0 is adjacent to cell c_1_1.\n- Cell c_3_0 is adjacent to cell c_3_1.\n- Cell c_3_1 is adjacent to cell c_3_0.\n- Cell c_0_2 is adjacent to cell c_1_2.\n- Cell c_2_3 is adjacent to cell c_1_3.\n- Cell c_2_1 is adjacent to cell c_2_0.\n- Cell c_2_1 is adjacent to cell c_2_2.\n- Cell c_3_3 is adjacent to cell c_2_3.\n- Cell c_0_1 is adjacent to cell c_0_2.\n- Cell c_3_2 is adjacent to cell c_2_2.\n- Cell c_1_1 is adjacent to cell c_0_1.\n- Cell c_2_3 is adjacent to cell c_3_3.\n- Cell c_3_3 is adjacent to cell c_3_2.\n- Cell c_0_1 is adjacent to cell c_0_0.\n- Cell c_1_2 is adjacent to cell c_2_2.\n- Cell c_1_2 is adjacent to cell c_0_2.\n- Cell c_2_1 is adjacent to cell c_3_1.\n- Cell c_1_3 is adjacent to cell c_0_3.\n- Cell c_3_2 is adjacent to cell c_3_1.\n- Cell c_1_1 is adjacent to cell c_2_1.\n- Cell c_0_3 is adjacent to cell c_0_2.\n- Cell c_2_0 is adjacent to cell c_2_1.\n- Cell c_1_2 is adjacent to cell c_1_3.\n- Cell c_0_0 is adjacent to cell c_0_1.\n- Cell c_1_0 is adjacent to cell c_2_0.\n- Cell c_1_1 is adjacent to cell c_1_0.\n- Cell c_1_0 is adjacent to cell c_0_0.\n- Cell c_1_1 is adjacent to cell c_1_2.\n- Cell c_1_3 is adjacent to cell c_1_2.\n- Cell c_2_0 is adjacent to cell c_1_0.\n- Cell c_2_2 is adjacent to cell c_2_1.\n- Cell c_1_3 is adjacent to cell c_2_3.\n- Cell c_2_1 is adjacent to cell c_1_1.\n- Cell c_3_2 is adjacent to cell c_3_3.\n- Cell c_0_3 is adjacent to cell c_1_3.\n- Cell c_0_1 is adjacent to cell c_1_1.\n- Cell c_3_1 is adjacent to cell c_2_1.\n- T1 is at cell c_2_1.\n- P1 is at cell c_1_3.\n- P2 is at cell c_2_3.\n- Truck t1 is empty.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - P1 is at cell c_2_0.\n  - P2 is at cell c_2_0.\n\n## Constraints\n- At all times during the plan, it is not the case that truck t1 was last at cell c_2_2 and t1 is at cell c_2_3 and it is not the case that truck t1 was last at cell c_2_3 and t1 is at cell c_2_2 must hold.\n\n### Plan:"
