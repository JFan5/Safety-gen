Solve the following problem based on the provided domain.\n\nDOMAIN:\n## Domain Overview\n\nThis domain features robots equipped with grippers that transport objects between rooms. Each robot can move between rooms and use its grippers to carry objects.\n\n## Actions\n\nThe following actions are available. Use the exact syntax shown when creating plans.\n\n**move** - Move a robot from one room to another\n  When: the robot is in the departure room\n  Result: the robot is in the destination room; the robot is no longer in the departure room\n  Syntax: (move <r> <from> <to>)\n\n**pick** - Pick up an object using a gripper\n  When: the object is in the same room as the robot, and the gripper is free\n  Result: the robot carries the object with that gripper; the object is no longer in the room; the gripper is no longer free\n  Syntax: (pick <r> <obj> <room> <g>)\n\n**drop** - Release an object from a gripper\n  When: the robot is carrying the object with a gripper\n  Result: the object is in the robot's current room; the gripper becomes free; the robot no longer carries that object\n  Syntax: (drop <r> <obj> <room> <g>)\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: gripper-strips\n\n## Objects\nRobot: robot1, robot2\nGripper: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2\nRoom: room1, room2, room3, room4\nObjects: ball1, ball2, ball3\n\n## Initial State\n- Robot robot1 is at room room1.\n- Gripper rgripper1 of robot robot1 is free.\n- Gripper lgripper1 of robot robot1 is free.\n- Robot robot2 is at room room2.\n- Gripper rgripper2 of robot robot2 is free.\n- Gripper lgripper2 of robot robot2 is free.\n- Object ball1 is at room room1.\n- Object ball2 is at room room1.\n- Object ball3 is at room room4.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Object ball1 is at room room1.\n  - Object ball2 is at room room3.\n  - Object ball3 is at room room4.\n\n## Constraints\n- At all times during the plan, it is not the case that robot robot1 is at room room3 must hold.\n\n### Plan:"
