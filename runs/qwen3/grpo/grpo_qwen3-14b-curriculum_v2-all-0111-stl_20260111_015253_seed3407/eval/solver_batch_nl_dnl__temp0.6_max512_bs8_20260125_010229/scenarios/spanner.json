The worker and spanners can be at locations. Nuts are at fixed locations and start loose. The worker can carry spanners. Each spanner is either useable or already used.\n\n## Actions\n\n**walk**: The worker walks from one location to an adjacent location. There must be a direct link between the locations, and the worker must be at the starting location. After walking, the worker is at the destination and no longer at the origin.\n\n**pickup_spanner**: The worker picks up a spanner. Both the worker and the spanner must be at the same location. After picking up, the worker carries the spanner, and the spanner is no longer at that location.\n\n**tighten_nut**: The worker uses a spanner to tighten a nut. The worker must be at the same location as the nut, must be carrying a useable spanner, and the nut must be loose. After tightening, the nut is tightened and no longer loose, and the spanner becomes unuseable.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: spanner\n\n## Objects\nMan: bob\nSpanner: spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, spanner4\nNut: nut1, nut2, nut3\nLocation: location1, location2, location3, location4, shed, gate\n\n## Initial State\n- Bob is at location shed.\n- Spanner1 is at location location3.\n- Spanner spanner1 is useable.\n- Spanner2 is at location location1.\n- Spanner spanner2 is useable.\n- Spanner3 is at location location1.\n- Spanner spanner3 is useable.\n- Spanner4 is at location location4.\n- Spanner spanner4 is useable.\n- Nut nut1 is loose.\n- Nut1 is at location gate.\n- Nut nut2 is loose.\n- Nut2 is at location gate.\n- Nut nut3 is loose.\n- Nut3 is at location gate.\n- Location shed is connected to location location1.\n- Location location4 is connected to location gate.\n- Location location1 is connected to location location2.\n- Location location2 is connected to location location3.\n- Location location3 is connected to location location4.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Nut nut1 is tightened.\n  - Nut nut2 is tightened.\n  - Nut nut3 is tightened.\n\n## Constraints\n- At all times during the plan, if it is not the case that nut nut2 is tightened, then it is not the case that nut nut3 is tightened must hold.\n- For bob: \"bob is at location shed\" is allowed to become true at most once during the entire plan.\n\n### Plan:"

Solve the following problem based on the provided domain.\n\nDOMAIN:\n## Domain Overview\n\nThis domain involves a worker who moves between connected locations, picks up spanners, and uses them to tighten nuts. Spanners are single-use tools: once a spanner tightens a nut, it can no longer be used.\n\n## Entities and State\n\nThe world contains **locations** connected by links, a **worker** (man), **spanners**, and **nuts**. The worker and spanners can be at locations. Nuts are at fixed locations and start loose. The worker can carry spanners. Each spanner is either useable or already used.\n\n## Actions\n\n**walk**: The worker walks from one location to an adjacent location. There must be a direct link between the locations, and the worker must be at the starting location. After walking, the worker is at the destination and no longer at the origin.\n\n**pickup_spanner**: The worker picks up a spanner. Both the worker and the spanner must be at the same location. After picking up, the worker carries the spanner, and the spanner is no longer at that location.\n\n**tighten_nut**: The worker uses a spanner to tighten a nut. The worker must be at the same location as the nut, must be carrying a useable spanner, and the nut must be loose. After tightening, the nut is tightened and no longer loose, and the spanner becomes unuseable.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: spanner\n\n## Objects\nMan: bob\nSpanner: spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, spanner4\nNut: nut1, nut2, nut3\nLocation: location1, location2, location3, location4, shed, gate\n\n## Initial State\n- Bob is at location shed.\n- Spanner1 is at location location1.\n- Spanner spanner1 is useable.\n- Spanner2 is at location location3.\n- Spanner spanner2 is useable.\n- Spanner3 is at location location4.\n- Spanner spanner3 is useable.\n- Spanner4 is at location location1.\n- Spanner spanner4 is useable.\n- Nut nut1 is loose.\n- Nut1 is at location gate.\n- Nut nut2 is loose.\n- Nut2 is at location gate.\n- Nut nut3 is loose.\n- Nut3 is at location gate.\n- Location shed is connected to location location1.\n- Location location4 is connected to location gate.\n- Location location1 is connected to location location2.\n- Location location2 is connected to location location3.\n- Location location3 is connected to location location4.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Nut nut1 is tightened.\n  - Nut nut2 is tightened.\n  - Nut nut3 is tightened.\n\n## Constraints\n- At all times during the plan, if it is not the case that nut nut1 is tightened, then it is not the case that nut nut2 is tightened must hold.\n- For bob: \"bob is at location shed\" is allowed to become true at most once during the entire plan.\n\n### Plan:"
