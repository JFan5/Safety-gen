This is only possible when the block has nothing on top of it (is clear), the block is on the table, and the arm is currently empty. After picking up, the arm holds the block, the block is no longer on the table, no longer clear, and the arm is no longer empty.\n\n**putdown**: The arm places the block it is holding onto the table. This requires the arm to be holding a block. After putting down, the block is on the table and clear, the arm becomes empty.\n\n**stack**: The arm places the block it is holding on top of another block. The target block must be clear and the arm must be holding a block. After stacking, the held block is on top of the target block and becomes clear, the target block is no longer clear, and the arm becomes empty.\n\n**unstack**: The arm picks up a block that is on top of another block. The top block must be clear, it must be on another block, and the arm must be empty. After unstacking, the arm holds the top block, the bottom block becomes clear, and the top block is no longer on the bottom block.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: blocksworld\n\n## Objects\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4\n\n## Initial State\n- The robot arm is empty.\n- Block b1 is on the table.\n- Block b2 is on block b1.\n- Block b3 is on block b2.\n- Block b4 is on block b3.\n- Block b4 is clear (nothing on top).\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Block b2 is on block b3.\n  - Block b3 is on block b1.\n  - Block b4 is on block b2.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"block b3 is on block b1\" becomes true, \"block b2 is on block b3\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"

Blocks can be stacked on top of each other, and the goal is typically to rearrange blocks into a desired configuration.\n\n## Entities and State\n\nThe world consists of **blocks** and a **robot arm**. Each block is either on the table or stacked on another block. A block is \"clear\" when nothing is on top of it. The arm can be empty or holding exactly one block.\n\n## Actions\n\n**pickup**: The arm picks up a block from the table. This is only possible when the block has nothing on top of it (is clear), the block is on the table, and the arm is currently empty. After picking up, the arm holds the block, the block is no longer on the table, no longer clear, and the arm is no longer empty.\n\n**putdown**: The arm places the block it is holding onto the table. This requires the arm to be holding a block. After putting down, the block is on the table and clear, the arm becomes empty.\n\n**stack**: The arm places the block it is holding on top of another block. The target block must be clear and the arm must be holding a block. After stacking, the held block is on top of the target block and becomes clear, the target block is no longer clear, and the arm becomes empty.\n\n**unstack**: The arm picks up a block that is on top of another block. The top block must be clear, it must be on another block, and the arm must be empty. After unstacking, the arm holds the top block, the bottom block becomes clear, and the top block is no longer on the bottom block.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: blocksworld\n\n## Objects\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5\n\n## Initial State\n- The robot arm is empty.\n- Block b1 is on the table.\n- Block b2 is on block b5.\n- Block b3 is on block b1.\n- Block b4 is on block b2.\n- Block b5 is on the table.\n- Block b3 is clear (nothing on top).\n- Block b4 is clear (nothing on top).\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - Block b1 is on block b5.\n  - Block b2 is on block b4.\n  - Block b4 is on block b3.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"block b2 is on block b4\" becomes true, \"block b1 is on block b5\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"

Blocks can be stacked on top of each other, and the goal is typically to rearrange blocks into a desired configuration.\n\n## Entities and State\n\nThe world consists of **blocks** and a **robot arm**. Each block is either on the table or stacked on another block. A block is \"clear\" when nothing is on top of it. The arm can be empty or holding exactly one block.\n\n## Actions\n\n**pickup**: The arm picks up a block from the table. This is only possible when the block has nothing on top of it (is clear), the block is on the table, and the arm is currently empty. After picking up, the arm holds the block, the block is no longer on the table, no longer clear, and the arm is no longer empty.\n\n**putdown**: The arm places the block it is holding onto the table. This requires the arm to be holding a block. After putting down, the block is on the table and clear, the arm becomes empty.\n\n**stack**: The arm places the block it is holding on top of another block. The target block must be clear and the arm must be holding a block. After stacking, the held block is on top of the target block and becomes clear, the target block is no longer clear, and the arm becomes empty.\n\n**unstack**: The arm picks up a block that is on top of another block. The top block must be clear, it must be on another block, and the arm must be empty.
