After sailing, the ferry is at the destination and no longer at the origin.\n\n**board**: A car boards the ferry. The car must be at the same location as the ferry, and the ferry must be empty. After boarding, the car is on the ferry and no longer at that location, and the ferry is no longer empty.\n\n**debark**: A car leaves the ferry. The car must be on the ferry, and the ferry must be at some location. After debarking, the car is at the ferry's current location, the ferry becomes empty, and the car is no longer on the ferry.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: ferry\n\n## Objects\nObjects: l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, c0, c1, c2\n\n## Initial State\n- L0 is a valid location.\n- L1 is a valid location.\n- L2 is a valid location.\n- L3 is a valid location.\n- L4 is a valid location.\n- L5 is a valid location.\n- C0 is a car.\n- C1 is a car.\n- C2 is a car.\n- L0 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l0 are different locations.\n- L1 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l1 are different locations.\n- L2 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l2 are different locations.\n- L3 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l3 are different locations.\n- L4 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l4 are different locations.\n- The ferry is empty.\n- C0 is at location l3.\n- C1 is at location l4.\n- C2 is at location l4.\n- The ferry is at location l3.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - C0 is at location l3.\n  - C1 is at location l3.\n  - C2 is at location l0.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"c1 is at location l3\" becomes true, \"the ferry is at location l0\" must be true at some point.\n- Before \"c2 is at location l0\" becomes true, \"the ferry is at location l1\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"

Solve the following problem based on the provided domain.\n\nDOMAIN:\n## Domain Overview\n\nThis domain involves a ferry that transports cars between locations. The ferry sails between locations and can carry cars from one place to another by boarding them at the origin and debarking them at the destination.\n\n## Entities and State\n\nThe world has **locations**, **cars**, and a single **ferry**. Each car is either at a specific location or on the ferry. The ferry is at exactly one location at any time and can be either empty or carrying a car.\n\n## Actions\n\n**sail**: The ferry travels from one location to another. The two locations must be different, and the ferry must currently be at the departure location. After sailing, the ferry is at the destination and no longer at the origin.\n\n**board**: A car boards the ferry. The car must be at the same location as the ferry, and the ferry must be empty. After boarding, the car is on the ferry and no longer at that location, and the ferry is no longer empty.\n\n**debark**: A car leaves the ferry. The car must be on the ferry, and the ferry must be at some location. After debarking, the car is at the ferry's current location, the ferry becomes empty, and the car is no longer on the ferry.\n\nPROBLEM (Natural Language Description):\n## Domain / Scenario\nDomain: ferry\n\n## Objects\nObjects: l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, c0, c1, c2\n\n## Initial State\n- L0 is a valid location.\n- L1 is a valid location.\n- L2 is a valid location.\n- L3 is a valid location.\n- L4 is a valid location.\n- L5 is a valid location.\n- C0 is a car.\n- C1 is a car.\n- C2 is a car.\n- L0 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l0 are different locations.\n- L0 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l0 are different locations.\n- L1 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l1 are different locations.\n- L1 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l1 are different locations.\n- L2 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l2 are different locations.\n- L2 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l2 are different locations.\n- L3 and l4 are different locations.\n- L4 and l3 are different locations.\n- L3 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l3 are different locations.\n- L4 and l5 are different locations.\n- L5 and l4 are different locations.\n- The ferry is empty.\n- C0 is at location l3.\n- C1 is at location l5.\n- C2 is at location l4.\n- The ferry is at location l1.\n\n## Goal\nAll of the following must be true:\n  - C0 is at location l5.\n  - C1 is at location l5.\n  - C2 is at location l4.\n\n## Constraints\n- Before \"c0 is at location l5\" becomes true, \"the ferry is at location l0\" must be true at some point.\n\n### Plan:"
