analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2 exist. cars c0, c1, c2 at l0. ferry at l0. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l0. at c0 l0, at c1 l0, at c2 l0. not-eq pairs: all distinct.
Goal: at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l1. So we need to move c1 and c2 to l1, keep c0 at l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l2)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l2 before c1 and c2 reach l1. So ferry must visit l2 before delivering c1 and c2 to l1. So plan must include ferry sailing to l2 before delivering cars to l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that board action requires at-ferry at location, empty-ferry, car at location, etc. Debark requires on car, at-ferry at location.
Goal: at c1 l1, at c2 l1. So we need to board c1 and c2 onto ferry at l0, sail to l1? Wait we need to deliver them to l1. But constraint says ferry must be at l2 before they reach l1. So we need to sail to l2 first, then to l1. But we also need to deliver them to l1. So we can board them at l0, sail to l2, then sail to l1, then debark them at l1. But we must ensure that at-ferry l2 occurs before at c1 l1 and at c2 l1. That will be satisfied if we sail to l2 before delivering them.
We also need to keep c0 at l0. So we don't move c0.
We need to ensure that at-ferry l2 occurs before at c1 l1 and at c2 l1. So we need to have at-ferry l2 before we debark c
