analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. cars c0, c1. not-eq relations between all pairs of locations (so all distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l3, at-ferry l3. So ferry starts at l3, empty. Both cars at l3.
Goal: at c0 l3 (car 0 at l3) and at c1 l0 (car 1 at l0). So we need to move c1 to l0, while c0 stays at l3.
Constraint: sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1). Means that at some point before the goal state (when c1 at l0), the ferry must have been at l1. So we need to ensure that at some point before the final state, the ferry visited l1. That is a temporal constraint: at some point before the goal, the ferry must be at l1. So we need to include a step where ferry goes to l1 before final state.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider actions:
- sail: from ?from to ?to, precondition: not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
- board: car ?car at ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
- debark: car ?car at ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
Goal: at c0 l3 (already true initially). at c1 l0. So we need to move c1 from l3 to l0. The ferry starts at l3. We can board c1 at l3, sail to l0, debark at l0. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at some point before goal, ferry at l1. So we need to include a step where
