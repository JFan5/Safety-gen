analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2, l3. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l0. at-ferry l3. So ferry starts at l3.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The constraints require that the action that achieves at c0 l2 must occur before the ferry reaches l0. Similarly for c1 l3 before ferry reaches l0. And c2 l3 before ferry reaches l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions: board: requires car at location, ferry at location, empty-ferry. board moves car onto ferry, sets on car, empties ferry? Actually effect: (on ?car) and not (at ?car ?loc) and not (empty-ferry). So after board, car is on ferry, ferry empty-ferry false.
debark: requires on car, ferry at location, location. effect: at car at location, empty-ferry true, not on car.
sail: requires ferry at from, location from and to, not-eq from to. effect: ferry at to, not at from.
We need to move cars to goal locations.
Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l3, c2 at l3.
Initial: c0 at l3, c1 at l2, c2 at l0. Ferry at l3.
We need to move c0 to l2, c1 to l3, c2 to l3.
We can board c0 at l3 onto ferry, sail to l2, debark at l2. That achieves at c0 l2. Then we need to get c1 to l3 and
