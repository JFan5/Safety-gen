## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me see what the goal is here. The problem is to get two cars, c0 and c1, from their current locations to specific destinations. Specifically, c0 needs to go from l4 to l0, and c1 needs to go from l2 to l1. 

First, I need to understand the initial state. The ferry starts at l0, and it's empty. c0 is at l4, and c1 is at l2. The ferry can only carry one car at a time. So, I think the plan will involve moving each car one by one.

Looking at the actions available, there's 'sail' which moves the ferry from one location to another, provided they're different and the ferry is at the origin. Then there's 'board' which loads a car onto the ferry, and 'debark' which unloads a car.

So, the first step must be to get c0 from l4 to l0. To do that, I need to board c0 onto the ferry. But the ferry is currently at l0, which is the starting point. Wait, no, the ferry is at l0, but it's empty. So, to board c0, the ferry needs to be at l4. So, I need to sail the ferry from l0 to l4.

Wait, but the ferry is at l0, and l4 is a different location. So, I can sail from l0 to l4. Once there, I can board c0. Then, I need to sail back to l0 with c0 on the ferry. But wait, the goal is to have c0 at l0, so after boarding, I can sail back.

But wait, the 'sail' action requires that the ferry is at a location and the destination is a different location. So, I can sail from l0 to l4, then board c0, then sail back to l0.

Similarly, for c1, I need to get it from l2 to l1. So, I need to sail the ferry from l0 to l2, board c1, then sail back to l1.

But wait, the constraints say that the constraints are (sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1)) and (sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l3)). Hmm, I'm not sure how that affects the plan.

Wait, the constraints are about the timing of when certain events happen. So, the 'at c0 l0' must happen before 'at-ferry l1', and 'at c1 l1' must happen before 'at-ferry l3'. I'm not entirely sure how to interpret that, but maybe it just means that the order of actions matters.

So, putting it all together, the plan would be:

1. Sail ferry from l0 to l4.
2. Board c0 onto ferry.
3. Sail ferry from l4 back to l0 with c0.
4. Then, sail ferry from l0 to l2.
5. Board c1 onto ferry.
6. Sail ferry from l2 back to l1 with c1.

Wait, but the goal is to have c0 at l0 and c1 at l1. So, after step 3, c0 is at l0, and the ferry is empty. Then, after step 6, c1 is at l1, and the ferry is empty again.

I think that's the correct sequence. Let me double-check the preconditions for each action.

For 'sail' from l0 to l4: location l0 and l4 are different, and the ferry is at l0. That's fine.

For 'board' c0: c0 is a car, the ferry is at l4, and the ferry is empty. That's correct.

For 'sail' back to l0: ferry is at l4 with c0, destination is l0, different location. Correct.

Similarly for c1: sail from l0 to l2, board c1, sail back to l1.

Yes, that seems to satisfy all the preconditions and goals.
