## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal, considering the constraints provided.

First, I'll look at the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have car c0 at location l4, c1 at l3, and c2 at l1. 

Looking at the initial state, I see that c0 is at l0, c1 is at l3, and c2 is at l0. The ferry is currently at l5, which is not the same as any other location, so I can sail the ferry to any location except l5. 

I need to get c0 to l4. Since the ferry is at l5, I can sail it to l4. But wait, I need to make sure that after sailing, the ferry is at l4 and not at l5 anymore. So, the action would be (sail ferry l4). 

After sailing, the ferry is at l4, and the empty-ferry is now at l5. Now, I can board the ferry with a car. Since c0 is at l0 and the ferry is at l4, I can board c0 onto the ferry. So, the action is (board c0 l4). 

Once c0 is on the ferry, I can sail the ferry again to another location. But I need to get c0 to l4, so maybe I should sail the ferry back to l4. Wait, but the ferry is already at l4, so I can't sail it to the same location again. Hmm, maybe I should first board another car. 

Looking at the initial state, c1 is already at l3, which is the same as the location of the ferry after it arrives at l4. So, perhaps I can board c1 onto the ferry. But wait, the ferry is at l4, and c1 is at l3. I need to move the ferry to l3 to board c1. 

So, I should sail the ferry from l4 back to l3. Then, I can board c1 onto the ferry. After that, I can sail the ferry to l1 to drop off c1. 

Similarly, for c2, which is at l0, I can board it onto the ferry when it's at l0 and sail it to l1. 

Wait, but the initial state has the ferry at l5, and I need to get it to l4 first to board c0. So the sequence should be:

1. Sail ferry from l5 to l4.
2. Board c0 onto ferry at l4.
3. Sail ferry from l4 to l3.
4. Board c1 onto ferry at l3.
5. Sail ferry from l3 to l1.
6. Drop off c1 at l1.
7. Sail ferry back to l0 to pick up c2.
8. Board c2 onto ferry at l0.
9. Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
10. Drop off c2 at l1.

Wait, but after step 5, the ferry is at l1. So in step 7, I can't sail to l0 because l0 is not equal to l1. So I need to find another way.

Alternatively, after dropping off c1 at l1, I can sail the ferry back to l0 to pick up c2. Then, board c2 and sail to l1 again. 

So the plan would be:

- Sail ferry from l5 to l4.
- Board c0 onto ferry at l4.
- Sail ferry from l4 to l3.
- Board c1 onto ferry at l3.
- Sail ferry from l3 to l1.
- Drop off c1 at l1.
- Sail ferry from l1 to l0.
- Board c2 onto ferry at l0.
- Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
- Drop off c2 at l1.

This should achieve the goal.
