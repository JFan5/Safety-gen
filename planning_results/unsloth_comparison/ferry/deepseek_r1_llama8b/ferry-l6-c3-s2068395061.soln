## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me see what the goal is here. The problem is to get three cars (c0, c1, c2) to their respective destinations: c0 to l2, c1 to l3, and c2 to l5. The ferry starts empty at location l4. 

First, I need to understand the initial state. The ferry is at l4, which is a ferry location. The cars are at l4 as well: c0 is at l4, c1 is at l1, and c2 is at l4. The ferry is empty, so it's ready to take cars on board.

Looking at the actions available, there's 'sail' which moves the ferry from one location to another, but only if they are different and the ferry is at the origin. 'board' is used to load cars onto the ferry when the ferry is empty and the car is at a location that's also a ferry location. 'debark' is used to unload cars when the ferry is at a location that's not a ferry location.

So, the plan needs to get each car to their destination one by one. Since the ferry can only carry one car at a time, I'll have to load each car, sail to their destination, and then unload them.

Starting with c0: the ferry is at l4, which is a ferry location. c0 is also at l4. So, I can board c0. Then, I need to sail to l2, which is a destination for c0. After that, I can debark c0 at l2.

Next, c1 is at l1. The ferry is currently at l2, which is not a ferry location. So, I need to sail back to l4 to pick up c1. Once at l4, I can board c1 and sail to l3, then debark c1 there.

Finally, c2 is at l4 again. After c1 has been delivered, the ferry is at l3. I need to sail back to l4, board c2, and sail to l5, then debark c2 there.

I also need to make sure that the constraints are satisfied. The constraints say that each action (boarding c0, c1, c2) must happen before their respective goals. So, the plan must ensure that each car is boarded and then delivered before the goal is achieved.

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Board c0 at l4.
2. Sail from l4 to l2.
3. Debark c0 at l2.
4. Sail from l2 back to l4.
5. Board c1 at l4.
6. Sail from l4 to l3.
7. Debark c1 at l3.
8. Sail from l3 back to l4.
9. Board c2 at l4.
10. Sail from l4 to l5.
11. Debark c2 at l5.

Each of these steps should satisfy all the preconditions and constraints. I don't see any immediate issues with this plan, so I think it should work.
