## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me first understand what's given and what needs to be done.

The domain is a ferry, and there are actions like sail, board, and debark. The problem is to get car c0 to location l5 and car c1 to location l3. The initial state has c0 at l0 and c1 at l4. The ferry is currently empty, and it's at l5.

First, I need to figure out the constraints. The problem mentions that (sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l1)) and (sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)). So, before moving c0 to l5, the ferry must be at l1, and before moving c1 to l3, the ferry must be at l0.

Looking at the actions:

1. Sail: moves the ferry from one location to another, but not to the same location. It requires the ferry to be at a location that's a ferry location. So, the ferry can sail from l0 to l1, l2, l3, l4, or l5, but not to itself.

2. Board: allows a car to board the ferry if the car is at a location, the ferry is at that location, and the ferry is empty. This results in the car being on the ferry and the ferry no longer empty.

3. Debark: allows a car to get off the ferry if it's on the ferry and the ferry is at the destination location.

So, the plan needs to move the ferry to l1 and l0 before moving the cars. Let's outline the steps:

- First, move the ferry from l5 to l1 using the sail action. This satisfies the constraint that before moving c0 to l5, the ferry is at l1.

- Then, board c0 onto the ferry at l1. Now, c0 is on the ferry, and the ferry is no longer empty.

- Next, move the ferry from l1 to l0 using the sail action. This satisfies the constraint that before moving c1 to l3, the ferry is at l0.

- Then, board c1 onto the ferry at l0. Now, both cars are on the ferry.

- Now, move the ferry from l0 to l3 using the sail action.

- Finally, debark c0 at l5 and debark c1 at l3.

Wait, but after moving the ferry to l3, we need to make sure that the ferry is empty again after debarking. So, the order should be:

After moving the ferry to l3, debark c0 first, then debark c1, or vice versa. It doesn't matter which order since both are at l3.

So, the plan steps would be:

1. Sail ferry from l5 to l1.

2. Board c0 onto ferry at l1.

3. Sail ferry from l1 to l0.

4. Board c1 onto ferry at l0.

5. Sail ferry from l0 to l3.

6. Debark c0 from ferry at l5.

7. Debark c1 from ferry at l3.

Wait, but after step 5, the ferry is at l3 with both cars on it. So, debarking both cars at l3 is correct.

But let me double-check the constraints. The constraints say that before moving c0 to l5, the ferry must be at l1, which is satisfied by step 1. Before moving c1 to l3, the ferry must be at l0, which is satisfied by step 3.

Also, all the preconditions for each action are satisfied in the initial state and during the plan.

So, the final plan is:

Sail ferry from l5 to l1.

Board c0 onto ferry at l1.

Sail ferry from l1 to l0.

Board c1 onto ferry at l0.

Sail ferry from l0 to l3.

Debark c0 from ferry at l5.

Debark c1 from ferry at l3.

Yes, that should work.
