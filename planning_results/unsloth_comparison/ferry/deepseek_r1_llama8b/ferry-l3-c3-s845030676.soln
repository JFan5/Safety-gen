## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me first understand what's given and what the goal is.

From the domain description, I see that the ferry can be in different locations, and cars can be on the ferry. There are actions like 'sail' which moves the ferry from one location to another, 'board' which puts a car on the ferry, and 'debark' which takes a car off the ferry.

The problem is to get cars c0, c1, and c2 to their respective destinations: c0 to l1, c1 to l1, and c2 to l2. The initial state has c0 at l2, c1 and c2 at l1, and the ferry is empty at l1.

Constraints say that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0, and before moving c2 to l2, the ferry must also be at l0. So I need to make sure that these constraints are satisfied.

Let me think about the steps:

1. First, I need to get the ferry to l0. But wait, the ferry is currently at l1 because it's at l1 with c1 and c2. So I need to sail from l1 to l0. But wait, the 'sail' action requires that the ferry is not at the same location as the destination. So I can sail from l1 to l0 because they are not equal.

2. Once the ferry is at l0, I can board c0. So I can perform 'board c0 l2' because c0 is at l2, the ferry is empty, and it's at l2 (which is the location of c0). After boarding, c0 will be on the ferry, and the ferry will be at l2.

Wait, no. Wait, the 'board' action requires that the car is at the location, the ferry is at the location, and the ferry is empty. So since the ferry is at l1 initially, and c0 is at l2, I can't board c0 until the ferry is at l2. Hmm, maybe I need to sail the ferry to l2 first.

Wait, but the initial state has the ferry at l1. So to get the ferry to l2, I need to sail from l1 to l2. But the constraint says that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. So perhaps I need to first sail the ferry to l0, then board c0, then sail back to l1.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

- Sail from l1 to l0 (since they are not equal). This satisfies the constraint for c0.
- Board c0 at l0. Now c0 is on the ferry.
- Sail the ferry back to l1. Now the ferry is at l1 with c0.
- Now, debark c0 at l1. So c0 is back on l1, and the ferry is empty.
- Then, I need to get c2 to l2. But the constraint says that before moving c2 to l2, the ferry must be at l0. So I need to sail the ferry to l0 again.
- Then, board c2 at l1. Wait, but c2 is already at l1. So I can board it to the ferry at l1.
- Sail the ferry to l2. Now, the ferry is at l2 with c2.
- Debark c2 at l2. Now, c2 is at l2.

But wait, what about c1? c1 is already at l1, and the goal is to have c1 at l1, so I don't need to do anything for c1.

So the steps would be:

1. Sail from l1 to l0.
2. Board c0 at l0.
3. Sail from l0 to l1.
4. Debark c0 at l1.
5. Sail from l1 to l0.
6. Board c2 at l1.
7. Sail from l0 to l2.
8. Debark c2 at l2.

Wait, but after step 4, the ferry is empty at l1. Then in step 5, I sail to l0, board c2 at l1, which is possible because the ferry is at l0, but c2 is at l1. Wait, no, the 'board' action requires that the car is at the location where the ferry is. So to board c2 at l1, the ferry must be at l1. So after step 4, the ferry is at l1, empty. So step 5: sail to l0. Then step 6: board c2 at l1. Wait, but the ferry is at l0, not l1. So I can't board c2 at l1 if the ferry is at l0. So I need to sail back to l1, then board c2.

Wait, let me correct that:

After step 4, ferry is at l1, empty.

Step 5: sail to l0.

Step 6: board c2 at l1. Wait, ferry is at l0, can't board at l1. So I need to sail back to l1.

So step 6: sail from l0 to l1.

Step 7: board c2 at l1.

Then step 8: sail from l1 to l2.

Step 9: debark c2 at l2.

So the correct sequence is:

1. Sail l1 -> l0
2. Board c0 l0
3. Sail l0 -> l1
4. Debark c0 l1
5. Sail l1 -> l0
6. Sail l0 -> l1
7. Board c2 l1
8. Sail l1 -> l2
9. Debark c2 l2

Wait, but after step 5, the ferry is at l0, empty. Then step 6: sail to l1. Now ferry is at l1, empty. Then step 7: board c2 at l1. Now ferry has c2. Then step 8: sail to l2. Then step 9: debark c2 at l2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the plan is:

(sail l1 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(debark c2 l2)

I think that's the correct sequence.

(sail l1 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(debark c2 l2)<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
