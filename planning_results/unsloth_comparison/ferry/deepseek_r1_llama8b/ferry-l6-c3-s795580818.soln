## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me start by understanding what's given and what needs to be done.

First, the domain is defined with several actions: sail, board, and debark. The objects involved are locations l0 to l5 and cars c0, c1, c2. The initial state has each car at a specific location, and the ferry is initially empty at location l2. The goal is to get each car to its target location: c0 to l1, c1 to l0, and c2 to l0.

Looking at the constraints, there are two important ones. The first is that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. Similarly, before moving c1 to l0, the ferry must be at l1. So, I need to make sure that these constraints are satisfied in my plan.

Now, planning the steps. I think the first action should be for c0 to board the ferry. But wait, to board, the ferry must be empty, and the car must be at its current location, which is l2. So, c0 is at l2, and the ferry is at l2. So, c0 can board the ferry.

After boarding, the ferry will be at l2 with c0 on it. Then, I need to sail the ferry to l0. But before that, I need to check the constraints. The constraint says that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. So, maybe I should first sail the ferry to l0 before moving c0.

Wait, but if I sail the ferry to l0, then the ferry is at l0, and c0 is on the ferry. But the constraint is about the ferry being at l0 before moving c0 to l1. So, perhaps I need to sail the ferry to l0 after c0 has boarded.

So, the sequence would be: board c0, then sail to l0, then debark c0 at l1.

But wait, after boarding, the ferry is at l2 with c0. Then, sailing to l0 would require that the ferry is at l0, but the constraint is that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. So, maybe I should sail to l0 before moving c0.

Alternatively, maybe I should first sail the ferry to l0, then board c0, then sail to l1.

Wait, but the initial state has the ferry at l2. So, to sail to l0, the ferry must be at l2, which it is. So, I can sail the ferry to l0.

After sailing to l0, the ferry is at l0, and the ferry is empty because the constraint says that the ferry must be at l0 before moving c0 to l1.

Then, I can board c0 at l0, because the ferry is now at l0 and empty.

After boarding, I can sail the ferry to l1, since l1 is a different location, and the constraint is satisfied because the ferry was at l0 before moving c0.

So, the steps would be:

1. Sail ferry from l2 to l0.
2. Board c0 at l0.
3. Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
4. Debark c0 at l1.

Similarly, for c1, the process would be:

1. Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
2. Board c1 at l1.
3. Sail ferry from l1 to l0.
4. Debark c1 at l0.

For c2, since it's already at l0, but the goal is to have it at l0, so no action is needed.

Wait, but the initial state has c2 at l0, and the goal is to have it at l0, so debarking is not necessary.

So, the plan would include actions for c0 and c1, but not for c2.

Now, considering the constraints again, the first constraint is that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. So, in my plan, I have to ensure that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry is at l0.

Similarly, before moving c1 to l0, the ferry must be at l1.

So, in the plan for c0:

- Sail ferry to l0 (step 1)
- Board c0 (step 2)
- Sail ferry to l1 (step 3)
- Debark c0 (step 4)

This satisfies the constraint because before step 3 (sailing to l1), the ferry was at l0.

For c1:

- Sail ferry to l1 (step 1)
- Board c1 (step 2)
- Sail ferry to l0 (step 3)
- Debark c1 (step 4)

This also satisfies the constraint because before moving c1 to l0 (step 3), the ferry was at l1.

So, the plan would be:

1. Sail ferry from l2 to l0.
2. Board c0 at l0.
3. Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
4. Debark c0 at l1.
5. Sail ferry from l0 to l1.
6. Board c1 at l1.
7. Sail ferry from l1 to l0.
8. Debark c1 at l0.

Wait, but after step 4, the ferry is at l1 with c0 debarked. Then, for c1, I need to sail from l1 to l0, but after that, the ferry is at l0 with c1.

But the initial state has c2 at l0, so no action is needed for c2.

So, the plan includes 8 steps.

Now, I need to make sure that all constraints are satisfied. The first constraint is that before moving c0 to l1, the ferry must be at l0. In the plan, step 3 is sailing to l1, which happens after step 2 (boarding c0 at l0). So, the constraint is satisfied.

The second constraint is that before moving c1 to l0, the ferry must be at l1. In the plan, step 7 is sailing to l0, which happens after step 6 (boarding c1 at l1). So, the constraint is satisfied.

Therefore, the plan should work.
