## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me first understand what's given and what needs to be done.

The domain is a ferry, and there are actions like sail, board, and debark. The problem is to get car c0 to location l5 and car c1 to location l0. The initial state has c0 at l4 and c1 at l3, both on the ferry. The ferry is empty initially.

First, I need to figure out the sequence of actions. The goal is to have c0 at l5 and c1 at l0. So, I think I need to sail the ferry from l4 to l5, but wait, the ferry can only sail if it's not at the same location as the destination. So, I can sail from l4 to l5, but then I need to make sure that after sailing, the ferry is at l5.

But wait, the initial state has the ferry at l4. So, I can sail from l4 to l5. That would move the ferry to l5, right? So, the action would be (sail c0 l5). But wait, the action is defined as (sail ?from ?to), so I need to specify the ferry as the from and the destination as to. So, it's (sail c0 l5).

After sailing, the ferry would be at l5, and the ferry would be empty because the action's effect is (empty-ferry). Wait, no, the effect is (empty-ferry) only if it's the first time. Wait, no, the effect is (empty-ferry) as part of the action's effect. So, after sailing, the ferry is empty.

But wait, the initial state is empty, so after sailing, it's still empty. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the action definition. The sail action has a precondition that the ferry is at the starting location, and the effect is that the ferry is now at the destination and not at the starting location. So, after sailing, the ferry is at l5 and empty.

Wait, no, the effect is (empty-ferry), which is a predicate, so it's true after the action. So, the ferry remains empty after sailing. So, after (sail c0 l5), the ferry is at l5 and empty.

Now, I need to get c0 to l5. So, I think I need to board c0 at l5. But wait, the board action requires that the car is on the ferry, the location is the ferry's current location, the car is at the location, and the ferry is empty. So, after sailing, the ferry is empty, so I can board c0 at l5.

So, the next action would be (board c0 l5). This would move c0 onto the ferry, making the ferry not empty, and c0 is now on the ferry.

Then, I need to sail the ferry from l5 to l0. So, I can sail from l5 to l0, but wait, the ferry is at l5, and l0 is a location. So, I can sail the ferry from l5 to l0. So, the action would be (sail c0 l0). Wait, no, the action is (sail ?from ?to), so it's (sail c0 l0). But wait, after boarding, the ferry is at l5, so I need to sail from l5 to l0.

Wait, no, the ferry is at l5, so the from is l5, and the to is l0. So, the action is (sail c0 l0). But wait, the action is defined as (sail ?from ?to), so it's (sail c0 l0). But the from is actually l5, so maybe I need to specify the from as l5. Wait, no, the action is defined with ?from and ?to, so I can use the ferry as the from. So, it's (sail c0 l0).

After sailing, the ferry would be at l0, and the ferry would be empty again. So, the effect is (empty-ferry). So, after this action, the ferry is at l0 and empty.

Now, I need to get c1 to l0. So, I think I need to board c1 at l0. But wait, the board action requires that the car is on the ferry, the location is the ferry's current location, the car is at the location, and the ferry is empty. So, after sailing, the ferry is empty, so I can board c1 at l0.

So, the next action would be (board c1 l0). This would move c1 onto the ferry, making the ferry not empty, and c1 is now on the ferry.

Then, I need to sail the ferry from l0 to l1. Wait, no, the goal is to have c1 at l0, so maybe I don't need to sail again. Wait, no, the goal is already achieved for c1. Wait, no, the goal is to have c0 at l5 and c1 at l0. So, after boarding c1 at l0, I don't need to do anything else for c1. So, the plan would be:

1. Sail c0 from l4 to l5.
2. Board c0 at l5.
3. Sail c0 from l5 to l0.
4. Board c1 at l0.

Wait, but after step 3, the ferry is at l0 and empty. So, step 4 can be done.

But wait, the problem is to get c0 to l5 and c1 to l0. So, after step 3, c0 is at l0, and step 4 gets c1 to l0. So, that's correct.

But wait, the initial state has c1 at l3, and the goal is to have c1 at l0. So, after step 4, c1 is at l0.

So, the plan is:

(sail c0 l5)
(board c0 l5)
(sail c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)

But wait, after step 3, the ferry is at l0 and empty. So, step 4 can be done because the ferry is empty.

But wait, the board action requires that the ferry is empty, which it is after step 3.

So, the plan is correct.

But let me check the constraints. The problem includes constraints:

(sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l0))
(sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1))

So, the first constraint is that before c0 is at l5, the ferry is at l0. The second constraint is that before c1 is at l0, the ferry is at l1.

In the plan, step 1 is sailing to l5, which makes the ferry at l5. So, after step 1, the ferry is at l5. So, the constraint is satisfied because before c0 is at l5, the ferry was at l0.

Similarly, step 4 is boarding c1 at l0, which is after the ferry was at l1? Wait, no, the ferry was at l0 after step 3. So, the constraint is that before c1 is at l0, the ferry was at l1. But in the plan, the ferry was at l0 before step 4. So, the constraint is not satisfied.

Wait, that's a problem. So, the plan as I thought doesn't satisfy the constraints.

So, I need to adjust the plan to satisfy the constraints.

The constraints are:

1. Before c0 is at l5, the ferry is at l0.
2. Before c1 is at l0, the ferry is at l1.

So, in the plan, after step 1, the ferry is at l5. So, before c0 is at l5, the ferry was at l4. So, the constraint is satisfied because before c0 is at l5, the ferry was at l0 (which is l4? Wait, no, l0 is a different location. Wait, no, l0 is a location, and l4 is another location. So, the constraint is that before c0 is at l5, the ferry is at l0. So, in the plan, before step 1, the ferry is at l4, not l0. So, the constraint is not satisfied.

So, I need to make sure that before c0 is at l5, the ferry is at l0. So, perhaps I need to sail the ferry from l4 to l0 first, then board c0 at l0, then sail to l5, then board c1 at l0.

Wait, but the goal is to have c0 at l5 and c1 at l0. So, let me think.

Perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Sail c0 from l4 to l0.
2. Board c0 at l0.
3. Sail c0 from l0 to l5.
4. Board c1 at l0.

But wait, after step 3, the ferry is at l5 and empty. So, step 4 can be done because the ferry is empty.

But let's check the constraints.

Before c0 is at l
