## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ferry problem. Let me first understand what's given and what needs to be done.

The domain is a ferry, and there are specific actions like sail, board, and debark. The problem is to get three cars (c0, c1, c2) from their initial locations to specific destinations. The initial state shows that c0 is at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. The goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because c0 is already at l2, and c2 is also at l2. Maybe I need to check the initial state again.

Looking at the initial state, it says (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), and (at c2 l2). The goal is to have (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), and (at c2 l2). So, actually, all cars are already at their destinations. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the goal is to have all cars at l2, but the initial state shows c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So, c1 needs to move from l1 to l2. But the goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. That seems contradictory because c0 is already at l2, and c2 is already at l2. Maybe the goal is to have all cars at l2, but the initial state already has c0 and c2 there, so only c1 needs to move.

Wait, no, the goal is (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2). So c0 and c2 are already there, and c1 is already at l1. So the goal is already satisfied. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the goal.

Looking back, the goal is to have (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), and (at c2 l2). The initial state already has c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So the goal is already achieved. That would mean the plan is to do nothing. But the problem is presented as a task, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is different. Let me check the problem again. The initial state is (location l0), (location l1), (location l2), (car c0), (car c1), (car c2), (not-eq l0 l1), (not-eq l1 l0), (not-eq l0 l2), (not-eq l2 l0), (not-eq l1 l2), (not-eq l2 l1), (empty-ferry), (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2). So c0 is at l2, c1 at l1, c2 at l2. The goal is to have them at (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2). So the goal is already met. That seems odd. Maybe the problem is to move cars from l0 to l2, but the initial state doesn't mention cars at l0. Wait, the initial state only mentions cars at l2, l1, and l2. So perhaps the problem is to have all cars at l2, but c0 and c2 are already there, and c1 is at l1. So the goal is to have c1 move to l2.

But the goal is to have (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2). So c1 is already at l1, so the goal is already achieved. That can't be right. Maybe the problem is to have all cars at l2, but the goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So c1 needs to stay at l1, which it already is. So the plan is to do nothing. But that seems too trivial.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the goal is to have all cars at l2, but the initial state shows c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So c1 needs to move from l1 to l2. But the goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2, which is already the case. So the plan is to do nothing. But that seems odd for a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to have all cars at l2, and the initial state is that c0 is at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So c1 needs to move to l2. But the goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2, which is already the case. So again, the plan is to do nothing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to have all cars at l2, but the initial state already has c0 and c2 there, and c1 is at l1. So the goal is to have c1 move to l2, but the goal is to have c1 at l1. That seems contradictory. Maybe the problem is to have c1 at l1, which it already is, so the plan is to do nothing.

I'm confused. Maybe I need to look at the actions available. The actions are sail, board, and debark. The sail action moves a ferry from one location to another, but it requires that the ferry is not empty and that the from and to locations are different. The board action moves a car onto the ferry, which requires the car to be a car, the location to be a ferry location, the car to be at the location, and the ferry to be empty. The debark action moves a car off the ferry, requiring the car to be on the ferry and the ferry to be empty.

In the initial state, the ferry is empty. So to board a car, we need to have the ferry empty. So perhaps the plan is to sail the ferry from l0 to l1, but the initial state doesn't mention the ferry's location. Wait, the initial state says (at-ferry l0), so the ferry is at l0. So to sail from l0 to l1, we need to have the ferry at l0, which it is, and the locations are not equal. So we can sail.

But the goal is to have the ferry at l2, but the initial state already has the ferry at l0. So perhaps the plan is to sail the ferry from l0 to l1, then from l1 to l2. But the goal is to have the ferry at l2, but the initial state already has the ferry at l0. So the plan is to sail the ferry to l1, then to l2.

But the problem is to get the cars to their destinations. So perhaps after moving the ferry, we can board the cars. Let me think.

First, the ferry is at l0. To board cars, we need to be at a ferry location, which l0 is. So we can board cars at l0. But the cars are at l2, l1, and l2. So to board them, we need to move the ferry to their locations.

Wait, the board action requires the ferry to be empty. So perhaps the plan is:

1. Sail from l0 to l1.
2. Board c1 at l1.
3. Sail from l1 to l2.
4. Board c0 and c2 at l2.
5. Sail back to l0 or somewhere else.

But the goal is to have c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So after step 4, c0 and c2 are at l2, but c1 is at l1. So that's the goal.

But the initial state already has c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So the plan is to do nothing. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to move c1 from l1 to l2, but the goal is to have c1 at l1. So the plan is to do nothing. That seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to have all cars at l2, but the initial state already has c0 and c2 there, and c1 is at l1. So the plan is to move c1 to l2, but the goal is to have c1 at l1. So the plan is to do nothing.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look at the problem again.

The problem is to produce a plan to achieve the goal, which is (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), and (at c2 l2). The initial state already has c0 at l2, c1 at l1, and c2 at l2. So the goal is already achieved. Therefore, the plan is to do nothing.

But that seems too trivial. Maybe the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it.
