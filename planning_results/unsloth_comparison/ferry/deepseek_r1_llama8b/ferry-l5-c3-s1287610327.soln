## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- No blank lines at the start or end; no trailing spaces; use a single space between tokens.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output. Remember: only lines matching the regex. No extra text of any kind.

<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this ferry problem. So, the goal is to get cars from their current locations to specific destinations without violating any constraints. The initial state shows that the ferry is at location l0, and cars c0, c1, and c2 are at l3, l2, and l4 respectively. The goal is to have c0 at l3, c1 at l2, and c2 at l0. 

First, I need to understand the actions available. There's the 'sail' action, which moves the ferry from one location to another, but only if they're different and the ferry is at the origin. The 'board' action lets a car board the ferry when the ferry is empty and the car is at the current location. Finally, the 'debark' action unloads a car when the ferry is at the destination location.

Looking at the constraints, there's a constraint that says the 'at c2 l0' must happen before the ferry is at l1. That means before we can get c2 to l0, the ferry must be at l1. So, I need to plan in a way that respects this timeline.

Let me outline the steps:

1. First, I need to get the ferry to l1. Since the ferry is currently at l0, I can sail from l0 to l1. But wait, the constraint says that 'at c2 l0' must happen before 'at-ferry l1'. So, I need to make sure that before I get the ferry to l1, c2 is already at l0. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, actually, the constraint is (sometime-before (at c2 l0) (at-ferry l1)). So, the 'at c2 l0' must happen before the ferry reaches l1. That means I need to get c2 to l0 before moving the ferry to l1.

So, step 1: Get c2 to l0.

To do that, I need to board c2 onto the ferry when the ferry is empty. So, first, I need to empty the ferry. But the ferry is currently at l0, which is a location, but it's also a ferry. Wait, the initial state says (at-ferry l0), so the ferry is at l0, and it's empty.

Wait, no, the initial state says (empty-ferry), so the ferry is empty, and (at-ferry l0). So, the ferry is at l0, and it's empty. So, to board c2, which is at l4, I need to get the ferry to l4 to board it.

Wait, but the ferry is at l0. So, to get to l4, I need to sail from l0 to l4. But the constraint says that before the ferry is at l1, c2 must be at l0. So, maybe I should first get c2 to l0 by moving the ferry to l4, board c2, then sail back to l0.

But then, the constraint says that before the ferry is at l1, c2 must be at l0. So, perhaps I need to do that first.

Let me try:

Step 1: Sail ferry from l0 to l4.

But wait, the initial state is (empty-ferry), so the ferry is empty. So, I can sail from l0 to l4 because l0 and l4 are different locations, and the ferry is at l0.

So, action: sail l0 l4.

After that, the ferry is at l4, and the effect is that the ferry is now at l4, and it's not empty.

Then, I can board c2 onto the ferry at l4.

So, action: board c2 l4.

Now, c2 is on the ferry, and the ferry is at l4, but it's no longer empty.

Then, I need to sail the ferry back to l0.

So, action: sail l4 l0.

Now, the ferry is back at l0, and c2 is on the ferry. But the initial state already had the ferry at l0, so this might have been unnecessary. Wait, but the constraint says that c2 must be at l0 before the ferry is at l1. So, perhaps this step is needed.

Wait, but after boarding c2, the ferry is at l4, and then we sail back to l0. So, the ferry is now at l0, and c2 is on the ferry. So, the constraint is satisfied because c2 is at l0 before the ferry moves to l1.

Now, the next step is to get the ferry to l1. So, action: sail l0 l1.

Now, the ferry is at l1, and c2 is still on the ferry.

But the goal is to have c2 at l0. So, we need to debark c2 at l0.

So, action: debark c2 l0.

After that, c2 is at l0, and the ferry is empty.

Now, the ferry is at l1, empty. So, we can board other cars.

Next, we need to get c0 to l3 and c1 to l2.

So, first, let's get c0 to l3.

To do that, we need to board c0 onto the ferry at l3.

But the ferry is currently at l1, empty. So, we need to sail the ferry from l1 to l3.

So, action: sail l1 l3.

Now, the ferry is at l3, empty.

Then, board c0 onto the ferry.

Action: board c0 l3.

Now, c0 is on the ferry, and the ferry is at l3, not empty.

Then, sail the ferry back to l0.

Action: sail l3 l0.

Now, the ferry is at l0, and c0 is on the ferry.

We need to debark c0 at l3.

Wait, no, the goal is to have c0 at l3. So, we need to debark c0 at l3.

But the ferry is at l0, and c0 is on it. So, we need to sail the ferry to l3.

But wait, after debarking, the ferry must be empty. So, let's do:

Debark c0 l0.

Wait, but the ferry is at l0, and c0 is on it. So, action: debark c0 l0.

After that, c0 is at l0, and the ferry is empty.

But the goal is to have c0 at l3. So, we need to get the ferry to l3, board c0, and then sail back.

Wait, but the ferry is empty. So, we need to get c0 to l3 first.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

After getting c2 to l0, the ferry is at l0, empty. Then, we sail to l1.

At l1, the ferry is empty. So, we need to get c0 to l3.

So, first, sail from l1 to l3.

Action: sail l1 l3.

Now, ferry is at l3, empty.

Board c0.

Action: board c0 l3.

Now, c0 is on the ferry.

Sail back to l0.

Action: sail l3 l0.

Now, ferry is at l0, with c0 on it.

Debark c0 at l0.

Wait, but the goal is to have c0 at l3. So, perhaps I need to do this differently.

Wait, no. The goal is to have c0 at l3, c1 at l2, and c2 at l0.

So, after getting c0 to l3, we need to get c1 to l2.

So, after getting c0 to l3, the ferry is empty again.

So, we can now get c1 to l2.

So, sail ferry from l0 to l2.

Action: sail l0 l2.

Now, ferry is at l2, empty.

Board c1.

Action: board c1 l2.

Now, c1 is on the ferry.

Sail back to l0.

Action: sail l2 l0.

Now, ferry is at l0, with c1 on it.

Debark c1 at l2.

Action: debark c1 l0.

Wait, no, the goal is to have c1 at l2. So, we need to debark at l2.

But the ferry is at l0, so we need to sail to l2 first.

But the ferry is empty after debarking.

So, perhaps:

After getting c1 on the ferry at l2, sail to l0.

Debark c1 at l0.

But the goal is to have c1 at l2.

Wait, perhaps I need to sail the ferry to l2, board c1, then sail back and debark.

But that seems redundant.

Wait, no. The ferry is at l0, empty. To get c1 to l2, I need to:

Sail ferry to l2.

Action: sail l0 l2.

Now, ferry is at l2, empty.

Board c1.

Action: board c1 l2.

Now, c1 is on the ferry.

Sail back to l
