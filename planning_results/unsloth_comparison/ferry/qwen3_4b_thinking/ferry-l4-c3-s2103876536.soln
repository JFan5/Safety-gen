We are given a domain and a problem. The domain is "ferry" and the problem is "ferry-l4-c3".
First, let's understand the problem:
- There are 4 locations: l0, l1, l2, l3
- There are 3 cars: c0, c1, c2
- Initial state:
- Locations: l0, l1, l2, l3 are all locations (with the given not-eq constraints)
- Cars: c0, c1, c2 are cars
- (empty-ferry) is true initially
- (at c0 l2), (at c1 l2), (at c2 l0) -> so c0 and c1 are at l2, c2 is at l0
- (at-ferry l1) -> the ferry is at l1
- Goal:
(at c0 l0), (at c1 l3), (at c2 l3)
- Constraints (from the problem):
(sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l3))
(sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0))
(sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l2))
Note: The constraint "sometime-before" means that the action (or event) that causes the state (at c0 l0) must happen before the event that causes (at-ferry l3) [which is the action that moves the ferry to l3? but note: the state (at-ferry l3) is a state that we get by the sail action that moves the ferry to l3]. However, note that the constraint is written as (sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l3)), meaning the state (at c0 l0) must occur before the state (at-ferry l3) occurs.
But note: the problem says the plan must satisfy the constraints.
Let's break down the problem:
We have a ferry that starts at l1. We have cars at l2 (c0, c1) and l0 (c2). We want to get:
c0 to l0
c1 to l3
c2 to l3
But note: the goal is (at c0 l0), (at c1 l3), (at c
