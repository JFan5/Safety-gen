Okay, let's try to figure out how to generate the plan for this ferry problem. So, the domain is about moving cars between locations using a ferry. The problem is called ferry-l3-c3. Let me first understand the problem setup.
The initial state has three cars (c0, c1, c2) all at location l0, and the ferry is at l0. The goal is to have c0 at l0, c1 at l1, and c2 at l1. Wait, that's a bit confusing because the goal says (at c0 l0), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l1). So c0 stays at l0, and c1 and c2 need to get to l1. But the initial state has all cars at l0, and the ferry is at l0. Hmm.
Wait, the constraints mention that (sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)) and similarly for c2. So the actions that move c1 and c2 to l1 must happen before the ferry is at l2. But the initial state has the ferry at l0. So the plan needs to get the ferry to l2 after moving those cars.
Wait, the problem is to get c1 and c2 to l1, but the constraints say that their arrival at l1 must be before the ferry is at l2. So the ferry has to be at l2 after those cars have arrived. But the goal is to have them at l1, so maybe the ferry needs to go from l0 to l1 first, then to l2? Wait, but the initial state has the ferry at l0.
Let me re-read the problem. The problem's goal is (at c0 l0), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l1). So c0 stays at l0, and c1 and c2 need to be moved to l1. The initial state has all cars at l0, ferry at l0.
The constraints are that the events (at c1 l1) and (at c2 l1) must happen before (at-ferry l2). So the ferry must be at l2 after those cars have arrived at l1.
Wait, but the problem is to get the cars to l1. So the ferry needs to go from l0 to l1 first, pick up cars, then go to l2? Hmm, maybe
