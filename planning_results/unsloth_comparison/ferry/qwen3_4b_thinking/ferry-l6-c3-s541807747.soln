We are given a domain and a problem. The domain is "ferry" and the problem is "ferry-l6-c3".
The problem has:
- Objects: locations l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5 and cars c0, c1, c2.
- Initial state:
- Locations: l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5 are all locations (with the given not-eq constraints).
- Cars: c0, c1, c2 are cars.
- (empty-ferry) is true initially.
- (at c0 l5), (at c1 l3), (at c2 l1)
- (at-ferry l0) is true.
- Goal:
(at c0 l3), (at c1 l2), (at c2 l2)
- Constraints (from the problem):
(sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l1))
(sometime-before (at c1 l2) (at-ferry l1))
(sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l3))
Note: The constraint "sometime-before" means that the event (at c0 l3) must occur before the event (at-ferry l1) in the plan.
We have three actions:
1. sail: from ?from to ?to (with ?from != ?to, and both are locations, and at-ferry ?from)
2. board: (car ?car) (location ?loc) -> requires: (car ?car), (location ?loc), (at ?car ?loc), (at-ferry ?loc), (empty-ferry)
3. debark: (car ?car) (location ?loc) -> requires: (car ?car), (location ?loc), (on ?car), (at-ferry ?loc)
Important: The initial state has the ferry at l0. The cars are at l5, l3, l1 respectively.
We need to move the cars to their goals:
c0 -> l3
c1 -> l2
c2 -> l2
But note: the constraints require that the events (at c0 l3) and (at c1 l2) happen before (at-ferry l1) and (at c2 l2) happens before (at
