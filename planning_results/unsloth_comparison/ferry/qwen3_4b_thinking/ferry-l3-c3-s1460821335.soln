We are given a domain and a problem. The domain is "ferry" and the problem is "ferry-l3-c3".
Let's understand the problem:
The domain has:
- Objects: locations l0, l1, l2 and cars c0, c1, c2.
- Initial state:
- (location l0), (location l1), (location l2)
- (car c0), (car c1), (car c2)
- (not-eq l0 l1), (not-eq l1 l0), ... (all distinct locations)
- (empty-ferry)
- (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2)
- (at-ferry l0)
Goal state:
(at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2)   [Note: the goal is the same as the initial state?]
Wait, the goal is written as:
(and (at c0 l2) (at c1 l1) (at c2 l2))
But the initial state already has:
(at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2)
So the goal is the same as the initial state? That would mean no actions are needed.
However, note the initial state has (empty-ferry) and (at-ferry l0). Also, the cars are at l2 and l1.
But the goal is to have the cars at the same locations as initially?
But wait, the problem says: "ferry-l3-c3". The problem might be that we have to move the cars to the ferry?
Let me reexamine the problem.
The initial state:
(at c0 l2) -> car c0 is at location l2
(at c1 l1) -> car c1 is at location l1
(at c2 l2) -> car c2 is at location l2
(at-ferry l0) -> the ferry is at l0
The goal is: (at c0 l2), (at c1 l1), (at c2 l2) -> same as initial.
But that would be a trivial problem. However, the problem name is "ferry-l3-c3", which might imply a more complex scenario.
Wait, the problem says:
