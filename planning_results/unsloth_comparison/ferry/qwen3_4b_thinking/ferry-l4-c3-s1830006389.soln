Okay, let's try to figure out how to generate the plan for this ferry problem. So, the domain is a ferry problem with specific actions: sail, board, and debark. The problem is called ferry-l4-c3, and it has four locations (l0, l1, l2, l3) and three cars (c0, c1, c2).
First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. Let me parse the problem description.
The initial state:
- Locations l0, l1, l2, l3 are all present.
- Cars c0, c1, c2 are present.
- All locations are distinct (no two locations are equal).
- The ferry is initially at l3 (since at-ferry l3 is in the init).
- At the start:
- c0 is at l2
- c1 is at l0
- c2 is at l1
- The ferry is empty (empty-ferry)
The goal is to have:
- c0 at l2 (already true initially)
- c1 at l3
- c2 at l2
Wait, the goal says (at c0 l2), (at c1 l3), (at c2 l2). So c0 needs to stay at l2, c1 needs to move to l3, and c2 needs to move to l2.
But the initial state has c0 at l2, c1 at l0, c2 at l1. The ferry is at l3. The constraints are that (sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l1)) and (sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l0)). So the action that moves c1 to l3 must happen before the ferry is at l1, and the action that moves c2 to l2 must happen before the ferry is at l0.
Hmm, the constraints are a bit tricky. Let me think step by step.
First, the ferry is at l3 initially. The cars are at l2, l0, l1. The goal is to get c1 to l3 and c2 to l2. Wait, c0 is already at l2, so maybe it's supposed to stay there. But the problem is that the ferry needs to move to pick up cars and take them to their destinations.
Wait, the goal is (at c0 l
