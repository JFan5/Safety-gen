We are given a domain and a problem. The domain is "ferry" and the problem is "ferry-l4-c3".
First, let's understand the problem:
- There are 4 locations: l0, l1, l2, l3
- There are 3 cars: c0, c1, c2
- Initial state:
- Locations: l0, l1, l2, l3 are all locations (with the given not-eq constraints)
- Cars: c0, c1, c2 are cars
- (empty-ferry) is true initially
- (at c0 l3), (at c1 l2), (at c2 l0)
- (at-ferry l3) is true
- Goal state:
(at c0 l2), (at c1 l3), (at c2 l3)
- Constraints (from the problem):
(sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0))
(sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0))
(sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l1))
Note: The constraint "sometime-before" means that the event (at-ferry l0) must occur after the event (at c0 l2) and (at c1 l3) and (at c2 l3) must occur after (at-ferry l1) for the third constraint? Actually, let's break down:
The constraints are:
1. (sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0)) -> the action that causes (at c0 l2) must happen before the action that causes (at-ferry l0) [but note: (at-ferry l0) is a state that happens when the ferry is at l0, which is caused by a sail action]
2. (sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0))
3. (sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l1))
But note: the constraint says "sometime-before" meaning that the event (at c0 l2) must occur before the event (at-ferry l0) in time. However, the event (at-ferry l0) is a state that is achieved by a sail action that moves the ferry to l0.
