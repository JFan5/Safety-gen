Based on the provided input, I have parsed the domain and problem descriptions, and the given planning rules.

I will now generate a grounded, totally-ordered plan for the provided problem in the grid domain.

Here is the plan:

```
(move pos4-4 pos3-4)
(pickup pos4-4 key2)
(pickup-and-loose pos3-4 key1 pos2-2)
(unlock pos3-4 pos2-2 key1 shape2)
(move pos3-4 pos2-3)
(move pos2-2 pos3-2)
(pickup pos2-2 key1)
(pickup pos3-2 pos1-3)
(pickup pos1-3 key0)
(move pos1-3 pos0-1)
(move pos0-4 pos1-4)
(move pos1-4 pos0-3)
(move pos2-0 pos1-0)
(pickup pos2-0 key0)
(pickup pos1-0 key1)
```

This plan assumes that the initial state given in the problem already satisfies all other preconditions for all actions, and the goal is achievable based on the provided domain. I have used only the objects and actions described in the domain and problem.
