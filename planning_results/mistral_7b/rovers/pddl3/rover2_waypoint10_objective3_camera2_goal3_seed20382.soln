Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective2 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 low_res waypoint6 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint8)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint8 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint9 waypoint8)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that rover0 can traverse between all the waypoints and that the initial state satisfies the preconditions for all the actions. It also assumes that the rover is initially equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoints 2, 4, and communicates the data to the lander at waypoint 0. It also takes an image of waypoint 6 with the low-res camera and communicates the image data to the lander. Finally, it communicates soil data from waypoints 8 and 9 to the lander.
