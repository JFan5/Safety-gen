Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover1 rover1store waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover1 general waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective0 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general waypoint6 objective0 low_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(take_image rover1 waypoint7 objective1 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general waypoint7 objective1 low_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint7 waypoint8)
(take_image rover1 waypoint8 objective2 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general waypoint8 objective2 high_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint9 waypoint1)
```

This plan assumes that the rovers can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan also assumes that the rovers are initially equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging, as specified in the problem. The plan ensures that the soil data from waypoints 1 and 3, the rock data from waypoints 1 and 2, and the images of objectives 0, 1, and 2 (in low-res and high-res modes) are communicated to the lander.
