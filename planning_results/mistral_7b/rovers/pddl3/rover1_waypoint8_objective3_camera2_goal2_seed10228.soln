Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint2 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint3 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint4)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint7 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the actions can be performed in the order given. It also assumes that the rover is initially equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging, and that the store is initially empty. The plan collects soil and rock samples, communicates the data to the lander, takes an image using the high-res camera, and finally communicates the image data to the lander. The plan satisfies all the goal conditions and hard constraints specified in the problem.
