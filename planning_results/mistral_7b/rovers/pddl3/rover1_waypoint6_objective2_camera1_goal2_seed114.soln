Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between all waypoints, and that the initial state satisfies the conditions for the actions to be executed. The plan collects rock samples from waypoints 4 and 5, drops the samples at the rover's store, navigates back to waypoint 0, communicates the rock data to the lander, collects a soil sample from waypoint 3, drops the soil sample at the rover's store, navigates to waypoint 2, communicates the rock data from waypoint 2 to the lander, navigates to waypoint 1, takes an image of waypoint 1 with the low-res mode camera, navigates back to waypoint 0, and communicates the image data to the lander.
