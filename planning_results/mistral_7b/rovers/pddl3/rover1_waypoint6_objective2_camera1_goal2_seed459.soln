Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective0 camera0 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 camera0 low_res waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between the waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the initial state satisfies all other preconditions for the actions in the plan. The plan collects soil samples from waypoint1, communicates the data to waypoint5, moves the rover to waypoint2, then to waypoint4 to collect a rock sample, moves to waypoint5, calibrates the camera, takes an image in low-resolution mode, and finally communicates the image data to the lander.
