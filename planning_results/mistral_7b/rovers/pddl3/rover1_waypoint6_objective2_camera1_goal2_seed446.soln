Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint2 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 objective1 camera0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 high_res waypoint3 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover is initially equipped for soil and rock analysis, imaging, and has a camera on board. The plan also assumes that the waypoints contain soil and rock samples, and that the objective0 and objective1 are visible from the corresponding waypoints. The plan collects soil and rock samples, calibrates the camera, takes an image in high-res mode, and communicates the image data to the lander.
