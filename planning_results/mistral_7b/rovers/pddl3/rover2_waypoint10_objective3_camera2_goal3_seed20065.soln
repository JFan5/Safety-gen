Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5 waypoint3)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1 waypoint5)
(take_image rover1 waypoint5 objective2 camera0 high_res)
(calibrate rover1 camera0 objective2 waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective2 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can perform soil and rock sampling, communication, and image taking as specified in the problem. The plan also assumes that the rover and lander are available and that the rover is equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging. The plan ensures that soil samples from waypoints 0, 6, and 7, a rock sample from waypoint 0, an image of waypoint 5 in high-resolution mode using camera 0, and the communication of soil data from waypoints 0, 6, and 7, rock data from waypoint 0, and image data from objective 2 in color are achieved.
