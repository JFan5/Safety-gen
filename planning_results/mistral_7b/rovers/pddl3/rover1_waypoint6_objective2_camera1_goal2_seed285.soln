Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective0 camera0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint2 waypoint4)
```

This plan achieves the goal of communicating the image data of objective0 using high-res mode to the lander at waypoint4. The plan assumes that the initial state satisfies all other conditions and constraints, including the rover being equipped for imaging, the camera being on board the rover, and the channels being free. If these conditions are not satisfied, adjustments may be necessary to the plan.
