Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 camera0 high_res)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint4 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 high_res waypoint1 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover is initially equipped for rock analysis and imaging. The plan collects rock samples and soil samples, drops the store, navigates back to the initial position, calibrates the camera, takes an image in high-resolution mode, and communicates the rock data and image data to the lander.
