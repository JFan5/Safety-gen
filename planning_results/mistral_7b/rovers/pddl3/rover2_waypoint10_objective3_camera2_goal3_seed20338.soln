This plan assumes that the rovers can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. It also assumes that the rovers have the necessary equipment for soil and rock analysis, imaging, and communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from various waypoints, communicates the data to the lander, and takes an image of one objective with the high-resolution camera.
