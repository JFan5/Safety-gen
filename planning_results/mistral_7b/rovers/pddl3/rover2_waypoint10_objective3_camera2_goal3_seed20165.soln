Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint9)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint9 waypoint0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint9)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint9 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective2 low_res)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective2 colour)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample rocks and drop samples as specified in the problem. It also assumes that the camera is already on board the rover and calibrated, as specified in the problem. The plan collects rock samples from waypoints 0 and 5, drops them off, navigates to objective 2, takes images, and communicates the images to the lander.
