Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint6)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint4 rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint7 waypoint6 rover0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 objective0 camera0 colour)
```

This plan will allow the rover to navigate to the specified waypoints, collect soil samples, communicate the data to the lander, and take an image using the high-resolution camera. The plan satisfies all the goal conditions and hard constraints specified in the problem.
