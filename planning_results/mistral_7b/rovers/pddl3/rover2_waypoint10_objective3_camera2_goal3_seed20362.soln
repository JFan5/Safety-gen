Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 high_res objective1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 low_res objective1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint9)
(take_image rover0 waypoint9 low_res objective1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint1 waypoint8 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 colour objective0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint8 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 low_res objective0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from various waypoints, takes images in high-resolution and low-resolution modes, and communicates the data back to the lander. The plan also ensures that the rover does not visit waypoint 4, as specified in the constraints.
