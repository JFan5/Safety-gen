Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint9 rover0 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint7 rover0 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint8)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint8 rover0 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(calibrate rover0 camera1 objective2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8)
(take_image rover0 waypoint8 objective2 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 high_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint1 rover1 rover1store)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint7)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint7 rover1 rover1store)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample soil or rock and communicate data to the lander as specified in the problem. The plan also assumes that the rover can take images and calibrate the camera as specified in the domain. The plan ensures that all goal conditions are achieved and all hard constraints are satisfied.
