Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 camera0 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample rocks and drop samples as specified in the domain. The plan also assumes that the camera is calibrated and supports the low_res mode, as specified in the domain. The plan achieves the goal of communicating rock data from waypoint1 and waypoint3 to the lander, and communicating an image of objective0 in low_res mode to the lander. The plan also satisfies the constraint that the rover visits waypoint5 before returning to waypoint1.
