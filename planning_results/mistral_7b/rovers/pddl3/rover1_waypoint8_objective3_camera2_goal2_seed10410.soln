Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint5)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint2)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective2 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the samples and images can be communicated to the lander as specified in the problem. The plan aims to collect soil samples from waypoints 5 and 1, communicate the data to the lander at waypoints 5 and 7, navigate to waypoint 2 to take a high-resolution image, and finally navigate to waypoint 0 to take a low-resolution image.
