Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5)
(take_image rover1 waypoint5 objective1 high_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint9)
(take_image rover1 waypoint9 objective1 colour)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective1 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective1 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between the waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the initial state satisfies the visibility and availability conditions for the actions. The plan also assumes that the rovers are equipped for soil and rock analysis, imaging, and that the cameras are calibrated for the required objectives. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoints 1, 3, and communicates the data to the lander at waypoint 1. It also takes images of waypoints 5 and 9 and communicates the image data to the lander. Finally, it navigates rover 1 back to the initial position at waypoint 0.
