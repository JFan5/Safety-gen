Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(drop rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective0 low_res camera0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample soil and rocks at the appropriate waypoints. The plan also assumes that the camera is calibrated for low-res mode and that the lander is available for communication. The plan ensures that rock data is communicated from both waypoint0 and waypoint5, and that image data is communicated for both objectives objective0 and objective1.
