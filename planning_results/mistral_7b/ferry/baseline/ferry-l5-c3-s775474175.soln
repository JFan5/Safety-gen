Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l2 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(sail l0 l3)
(board c1 l3)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c2 l4)
(sail l4 l2)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location `l2` to `l0`, boards the cars `c0` and `c1` onto the ferry at locations `l0` and `l3` respectively, moves the ferry from `l0` to `l3`, boards car `c2` at location `l3`, moves the ferry from `l3` to `l4`, and finally moves the ferry from `l4` back to `l2`. This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
