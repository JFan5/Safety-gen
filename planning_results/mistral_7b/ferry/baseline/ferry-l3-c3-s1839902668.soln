Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l2 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c2 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location l2 to l0, boards the cars c0, c1, and c2 onto the ferry at location l0, then moves the ferry to location l1, and finally debarks the cars at location l1. This plan satisfies all the preconditions of each action, respects the domain and problem constraints, and achieves the goal of having cars c0, c1, and c2 at location l1.
