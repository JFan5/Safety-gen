Based on the provided rules, here's the automated plan generation for the given domain and problem:

```
(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(sail l2 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(debark c0 l0)
(debark c1 l0)
(debark c2 l0)
```

This plan is sequential, grounded, and should satisfy all the conditions from the rules. It assumes that the initial state satisfies the given preconditions for each action.
