Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to achieve the goal is as follows:

```
(sail l4 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(debark c1 l0)
(debark c2 l0)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location l4 to l1, boards cars c1 and c2 onto the ferry at location l1, then moves the ferry from location l1 to l0, and finally debarks cars c1 and c2 at location l0. This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal stated in the problem.
