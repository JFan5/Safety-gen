Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to achieve the goal is as follows:

```
(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
```

This plan will move the ferry from location l0 to l1, board the cars c0, c1, and c2, and then move the ferry back to location l0. This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal specified in the problem.
