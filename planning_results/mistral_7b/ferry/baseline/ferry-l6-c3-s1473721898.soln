Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l3 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c1 l3)
(debark c2 l3)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location l3 to l1, boards the cars c0, c1, and c2 on the ferry at location l1, and then moves the ferry back to location l3, debarking the cars at their new destination.
