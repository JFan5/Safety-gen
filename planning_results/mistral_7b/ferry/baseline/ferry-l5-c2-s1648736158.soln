Based on the provided domain and problem, the planning engine would produce the following output:

```
(sail l2 l3)
(board c1 l3)
(sail l3 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(sail l2 l0)
(debark c0 l0)
(sail l0 l4)
(debark c1 l4)
```

This plan moves the cars from their initial locations to their goal locations using the `sail` and `board` actions. The `debark` action is used to remove the cars from the ferry once they have reached their destination. The `sail` action changes the location of the ferry, while the `board` and `debark` actions change the location of the cars. The order of the actions ensures that the constraints specified in the problem are satisfied.
