Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l4 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c1 l2)
```

This plan moves the cars from location l4 to l0, then sails the ferry to location l1, debarks the cars at l1, sails the ferry to location l2, and finally boards car c1 at location l2. This plan satisfies all the preconditions, respects the domain, and fulfills the goal while also satisfying the constraint that sometime before (at c1 l2), the ferry is at location l0.
