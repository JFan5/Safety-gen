Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l4 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l4)
(debark c0 l4)
(debark c1 l4)
(debark c2 l4)
(sail l4 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(board c1 l3)
(board c2 l5)
```

This plan moves the cars from their initial locations to the desired ones, respecting the domain and problem constraints. The plan assumes that the ferry is initially at location `l4` and is empty. The sail action moves the ferry between locations, while the board and debark actions manage the cars on and off the ferry.
