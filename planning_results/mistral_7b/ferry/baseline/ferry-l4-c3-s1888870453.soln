Based on the rules provided, the output should be a sequence of action steps, one per line, formatted as follows: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2> ...)`.

Here is the plan for the given problem:

```
(sail l0 l3)
(sail l3 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(debark c0 l0)
(debark c1 l0)
(debark c2 l0)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location `l0` to `l3`, boards the cars `c0`, `c1`, and `c2` at location `l1`, and then debarks them at location `l0`, achieving the given goal state.
