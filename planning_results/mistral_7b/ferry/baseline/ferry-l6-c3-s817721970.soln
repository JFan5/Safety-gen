Based on the given rules and the problem statement, the following plan is produced:

```
(sail l1 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(board c2 l2)
(sail l2 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(debark c2 l1)
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints mentioned in the problem and uses only the available symbols defined in the domain and problem. It also follows the required format for the plan output.
