Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here is the plan:

```
(sail l2 l0)
(sail l4 l1)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l2)
(sail l0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c1 l2)
(debark c2 l0)
```

This plan will move the ferry from locations l2 and l4 to l0 and l3 respectively, board the cars onto the ferry at the new locations, and then debark them at the final destinations.
