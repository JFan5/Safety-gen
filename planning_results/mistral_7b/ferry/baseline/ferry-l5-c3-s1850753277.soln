Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l2 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l2)
(debark c0 l2)
(debark c1 l2)
(debark c2 l2)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location `l2` to `l0`, boards the cars `c0`, `c1`, and `c2` on the ferry at location `l0`, and then moves the ferry back to location `l2`, debarking the cars at their new locations.
