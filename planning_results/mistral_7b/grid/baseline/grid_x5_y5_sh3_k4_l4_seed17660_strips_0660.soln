Based on the provided domain and problem, the following plan is produced:

```
(move pos4-2 pos4-3)
(pickup pos4-3 key3)
(move pos4-3 pos2-2)
(drop key3 pos2-2)
(move pos2-2 pos1-2)
(pickup pos1-2 key3)
```

This plan starts by moving the robot to the position containing key3 (initially at position pos1-2), picking up key3, moving to position pos2-2, dropping key3, and finally moving key3 to the final destination position pos2-1.
