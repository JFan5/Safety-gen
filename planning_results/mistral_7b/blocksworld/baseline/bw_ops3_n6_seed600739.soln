Based on your description, I will produce the grounded and sequential plan for the given problem. Here is the plan:

```
(pickup b1)
(unstack b1 b4)
(stack b1 b3)
(putdown b1)
(pickup b4)
(stack b4 b6)
(putdown b4)
(pickup b5)
(unstack b5 b2)
(stack b5 b1)
(putdown b5)
(stack b2 b3)
(putdown b2)
(stack b3 b2)
(putdown b3)
```
