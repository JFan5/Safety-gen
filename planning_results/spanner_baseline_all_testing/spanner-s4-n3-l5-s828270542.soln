Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location5)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location4)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are picked up, and that the nut to be tightened is always at the location where the corresponding spanner is. The plan also respects the constraints provided in the problem.
