Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner4 location1)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(walk bob location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 location4)
(pickup_nut bob nut1 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(drop spanner1 nut1 gate)
(pickup_nut bob nut2 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop spanner2 nut2 gate)
(pickup_nut bob nut3 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
(drop spanner3 nut3 gate)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten a nut is the one that is currently being carried by the man. Also, the nut being tightened is the one that is currently at the specified location.
