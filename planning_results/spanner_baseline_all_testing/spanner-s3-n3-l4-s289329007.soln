Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten a nut is the one that the man is currently carrying. The order of tightening the nuts is determined by the constraint `(sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3))`. If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, the plan would be empty. If the task is unsatisfiable, the output would be `(NO-PLAN)`.
