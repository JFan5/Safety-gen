Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(use spanner1 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 bob nut1)
(drop spanner1 bob location3)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(use spanner1 nut2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 bob nut2)
(drop spanner1 bob location1)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner is useable at the beginning, and the nuts are loose. If the problem specifies otherwise, the plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
