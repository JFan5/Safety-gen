Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location1)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4 location1)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob shed location1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are picked up in the order they are declared in the problem, and that the man can use the first spanner on the nut at the current location before picking up the second spanner. The plan also assumes that the man drops the spanners in the reverse order of picking them up.
