Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location1 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob shed)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner can be used in any order, and the man can carry both spanners at the same time. If there are any constraints in the domain that prevent this, the plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
