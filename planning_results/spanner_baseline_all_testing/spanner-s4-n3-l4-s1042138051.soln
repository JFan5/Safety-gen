Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten all nuts can be generated as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob gate location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location1 location4)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob gate location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location1 location3)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut3)
(walk bob gate location2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are available, and the man can carry only one spanner at a time. The plan also respects the constraints given in the problem, ensuring that the man does not enter the shed multiple times.
