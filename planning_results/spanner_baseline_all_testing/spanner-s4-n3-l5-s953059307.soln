Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut2)
(walk bob location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut3)
(walk bob location5)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 shed)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used in the `use_spanner` action is always the one that the man is currently carrying. The plan also assumes that the spanner is useable at each location where it is found. If this is not the case, the plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
