Based on the provided domain and problem, and adhering to the rules mentioned, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob gate)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut3)
(walk bob location4)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
```

This plan assumes that spanner1 is initially useable, and that spanner2 and spanner3 can be used after being picked up. The plan tightens the nuts in the given order, with the first nut being tightened before the second and third ones.
