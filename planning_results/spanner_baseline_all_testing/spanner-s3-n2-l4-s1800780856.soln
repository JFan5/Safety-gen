Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1 bob)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(putdown_spanner bob spanner1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(putdown_spanner bob spanner2)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2 bob)
```

Please note that the `putdown_spanner` action is not explicitly defined in the provided domain, so it's an assumption that putting down a spanner can be achieved by reversing the `pickup_spanner` action. If this is not the case, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Also, it is assumed that the spanner being used is the one that is carried by the man at each step. If there is a way to select which spanner to use in the `tighten_nut` action, that should be addressed in the plan generation process.

Lastly, the plan assumes that the man can move through the locations in the order specified. If there are constraints on the order in which locations can be connected, those should be taken into account in the plan generation process.
