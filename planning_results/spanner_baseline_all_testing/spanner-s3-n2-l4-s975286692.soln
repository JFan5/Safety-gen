Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten both nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob gate location1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location1 shed)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner being used is the one that is currently available and usable. The plan first moves the man to the location of the first nut, picks up the first spanner, moves to the location of the second nut, picks up the second spanner, uses the first spanner to tighten the first nut, drops the first spanner, uses the second spanner to tighten the second nut, drops the second spanner, and finally moves back to the shed.
