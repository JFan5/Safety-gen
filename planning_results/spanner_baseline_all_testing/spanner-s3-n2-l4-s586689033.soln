Based on the rules provided, the plan for the given domain and problem can be generated as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob gate location4)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut2)
```

This plan follows the provided guidelines by using only the objects and actions declared in the domain and problem, having no variables, no timestamps, no durations, and no extra text. It also ensures that all action preconditions hold in the current state, and the plan satisfies the given constraint (that `sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)`).
