Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in order (spanner1 for nut1 and spanner2 for nut2) and that the spanners are used only once. The plan also assumes that the man (bob) can carry only one spanner at a time. If these assumptions are not valid, the plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
