Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten all nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(drop spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(drop spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(drop spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location4 location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3 bob)
```

This plan assumes that spanner1 and spanner2 are useable, and nut1, nut2, and nut3 are loose. The plan satisfies the given problem and constraints.
