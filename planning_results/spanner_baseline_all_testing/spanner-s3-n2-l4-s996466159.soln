Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob gate location1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location1 shed)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten the first nut is spanner1, and the spanner used to tighten the second nut is spanner2. The plan also assumes that the man (bob) moves from shed to location1, then to location2, then to location3, and finally back to shed. The spanners are picked up and dropped at the corresponding locations. The nut to be tightened is moved to the shed before tightening, and then moved back to the gate after tightening.
