Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules specified, here is the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner4 bob)
(walk bob location4 location5)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location5 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner4 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner being used is always the one currently being carried by the man, and that the nut to be tightened is always the one located at the current location. The plan also assumes that the spanner is useable at each location where it is found. If this is not the case, the plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
