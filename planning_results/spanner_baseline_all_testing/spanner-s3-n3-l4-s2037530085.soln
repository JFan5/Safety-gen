Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten nuts 1, 2, and 3 is as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that spanner1, spanner2, and spanner3 are useable at the start, and nut1, nut2, and nut3 are loose at the start. Also, the links between locations as defined in the problem hold. The plan moves the man from the shed to each nut location, picks up the appropriate spanner, and then tightens the nut. After tightening each nut, the man moves back to the shed to pick up the next spanner and repeat the process.
