Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location5)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location1 gate)
(use_spanner bob nut1 spanner1)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(use_spanner bob nut2 spanner2)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob nut3 spanner3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are picked up, and that the nut being tightened is the one located at the current position when the man arrives with the appropriate spanner.
