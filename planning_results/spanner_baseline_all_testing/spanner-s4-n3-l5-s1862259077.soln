Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location5)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are available, and the man can carry only one spanner at a time. The plan also satisfies the given constraints.
