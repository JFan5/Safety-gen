Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(drop spanner1 bob nut1)
(walk bob gate location4)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(drop spanner2 bob nut2)
(walk bob shed location1)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten the first nut (spanner1) is still usable after tightening nut1, and the same for spanner2 when tightening nut2. If this is not the case, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
