Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(walk bob location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob gate)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location1)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner can be used only once, as suggested by the `useable` predicate and the constraint `(forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)))`. If this assumption is incorrect, the plan may need to be adjusted.
