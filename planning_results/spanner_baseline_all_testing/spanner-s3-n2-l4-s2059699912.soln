Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob shed location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob shed location1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner being used is the one that is currently available and usable, and the nut to be tightened is the one that is loose and located at the gate. The plan also respects the constraints provided in the problem.
