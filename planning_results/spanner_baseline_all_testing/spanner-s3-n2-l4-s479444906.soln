Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten both nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob nut1 spanner1)
(walk bob gate location4)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(use_spanner bob nut2 spanner2)
(walk bob shed location4)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are picked up in the order they are declared in the problem, and that the man can carry only one spanner at a time. The plan also assumes that the man walks to the locations in the order specified, and that the nut tightening action is performed at the final location before returning to the shed.
