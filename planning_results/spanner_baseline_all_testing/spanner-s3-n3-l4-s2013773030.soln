Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are in order from left to right in the locations they are initially placed in, and that the nuts are also in order from left to right in the gate. The plan moves the man (bob) to each location, picks up the appropriate spanner, and then tightens the nut in that location.
