Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(walk bob gate location5)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location5 location2)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(walk bob gate location5)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location5 location2)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are usable at the given locations and that the nuts are loose at the gate. The plan tightens the nuts in the order nut1, nut2, and nut3.
