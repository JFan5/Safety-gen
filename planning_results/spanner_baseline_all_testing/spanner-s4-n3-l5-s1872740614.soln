Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut3 bob)
(walk bob location4 location5)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used for tightening each nut is the one that is currently being carried by the man. The plan starts with the man (bob) in the shed, picks up the first spanner from location1, and then moves to each location where the nuts are located, tightening them with the spanner. After tightening all nuts, the man ends up in location5.
