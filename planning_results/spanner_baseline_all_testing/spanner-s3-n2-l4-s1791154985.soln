Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut2)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(drop spanner1 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten nut1 is spanner1, and the spanner used to tighten nut2 is the same spanner (since they are the only spanners available). The plan also assumes that the man (bob) starts at the shed and moves to the respective locations to perform the actions.
