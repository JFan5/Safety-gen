Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten all nuts can be as follows:

```
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan first picks up spanner1 and moves to location2, where it uses the spanner to tighten nut1. After that, the spanner is dropped, and the process is repeated for the remaining nuts and spanners.
