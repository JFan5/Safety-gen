Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(use_spanner bob nut1 spanner1)
(use_spanner bob nut2 spanner2)
(use_spanner bob nut3 spanner3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are picked up in the correct order, and that the nut being tightened is the one at the current location. The plan also respects the constraints given in the problem.
