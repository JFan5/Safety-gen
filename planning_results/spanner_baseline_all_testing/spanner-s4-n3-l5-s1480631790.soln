Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut1)
(walk bob location5)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut2)
(walk bob gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are picked up, and that the nut to be tightened with a spanner is always at the location where the man is. The plan also satisfies the given constraints, as the man Bob never enters the shed more than once.
