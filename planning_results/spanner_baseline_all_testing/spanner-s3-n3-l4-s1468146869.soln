Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut3)
(walk bob location2 location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are used in the order they are available, and the man (bob) carries only one spanner at a time. The plan also respects the constraints provided in the problem, ensuring that the man (bob) visits each location exactly once.
