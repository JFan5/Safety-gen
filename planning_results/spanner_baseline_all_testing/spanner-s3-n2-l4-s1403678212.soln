Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(walk bob location3 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner can be used after being picked up and dropped off, and that the man can carry only one spanner at a time. The plan also assumes that the man can walk between locations in the given order.
