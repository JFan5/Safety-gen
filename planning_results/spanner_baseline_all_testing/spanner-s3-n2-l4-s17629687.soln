Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten both nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location1 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner being used is the one that is currently available and usable. The plan also assumes that the man moves from one location to another in a sequential manner as specified in the problem. The nuts are tightened one after the other, with the first action tightening nut1 and the second action tightening nut2.
