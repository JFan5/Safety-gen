Based on the provided domain and problem, and adhering to the rules you've specified, the plan to tighten all nuts would be as follows:

```
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob nut1)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2)
(use_spanner bob nut2)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3)
(use_spanner bob nut3)
```

This plan assumes that:

1. Spanner1, spanner2, and spanner3 are all usable to tighten the respective nuts.
2. The man Bob can walk from the shed to location1, location1 to location2, location2 to location3, and location3 to location4.
3. The nut1, nut2, and nut3 are all loose initially, and the initial state satisfies all constraints (if any).
