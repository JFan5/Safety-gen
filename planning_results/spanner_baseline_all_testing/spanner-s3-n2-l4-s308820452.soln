Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob gate location1)
(drop spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(drop spanner3 bob)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used for tightening nut1 is spanner1, and the spanner used for tightening nut2 is spanner2. The plan also assumes that the man (bob) moves from shed to location1, then to location2, then to location3, then to location4, and finally back to location1. The spanners are picked up and dropped at the appropriate locations.
