Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 location4)
(putdown_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2 nut2)
(walk bob shed location1)
```

This plan assumes that the domain does not have an action for putting down a spanner, so I've used `putdown_spanner` as a placeholder. If the domain does have such an action, you should replace `putdown_spanner` with the appropriate action name.
