Based on the provided domain and problem, here's a plan that satisfies all the constraints and conditions.

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(use spanner1 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(drop spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(use spanner2 nut2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(drop spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(use spanner3 nut3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
(drop spanner3 bob)
```

This plan starts with Bob walking from the shed to location1, picking up spanner1, and then moving to each of the remaining locations, picking up the corresponding spanner, and using each spanner to tighten the corresponding nut. After tightening each nut, Bob drops the corresponding spanner. The plan satisfies all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.
