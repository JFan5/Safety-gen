Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut1 nut1)
(drop_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location2 location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2 nut2)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used for tightening nut1 (spanner3) is useable and that the spanner used for tightening nut2 (spanner2) is also useable after the first nut is tightened. If this is not the case, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
