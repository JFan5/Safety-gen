Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(use_spanner bob spanner2 nut2)
(use_spanner bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner can be used in any order, and that the nut is tightened one at a time. If there are any additional constraints in the domain or problem that would prevent this plan from being valid, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
