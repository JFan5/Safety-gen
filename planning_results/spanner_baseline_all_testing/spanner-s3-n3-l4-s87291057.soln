Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob location4)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are in order from left to right in locations 1, 2, and 3, and the nuts are in order from left to right in the gate. The plan tightens the nuts in the order specified in the goal.
