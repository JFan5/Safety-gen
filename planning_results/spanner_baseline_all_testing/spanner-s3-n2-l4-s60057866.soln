Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten both nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use_spanner bob nut1 spanner1)
(walk bob location4 gate)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(use_spanner bob nut2 spanner2)
(walk bob shed)
(drop_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner can be used in any order, and that the man can carry only one spanner at a time. The plan also satisfies the given constraints, as the man visits each location only once, and the tightening of nut1 happens before nut2.
