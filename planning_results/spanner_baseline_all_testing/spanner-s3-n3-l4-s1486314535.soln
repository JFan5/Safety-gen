Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
(walk bob location3)
(tighten_nut bob spanner3 nut3)
```

This plan assumes that the spanners are in order from left to right as locations, and the nuts are in order from top to bottom at the gate. The plan starts by moving Bob from the shed to location1, picking up spanner1, then moving to location2, picking up spanner2, and so on. Finally, it tightens each nut with the appropriate spanner.
