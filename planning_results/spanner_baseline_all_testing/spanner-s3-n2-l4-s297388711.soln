Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2)
(walk bob location3)
(walk bob location4)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner3 bob)
(walk bob gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner being used to tighten a nut is the correct one for that nut, and that the spanner is useable after being used to tighten a nut. The plan also assumes that the nut is loose at the start and that the spanner is carried by the man after being picked up. The plan also satisfies the constraints specified in the problem.
