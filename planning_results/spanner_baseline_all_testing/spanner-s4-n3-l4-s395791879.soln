Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan to tighten all nuts:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location1 location2)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut1)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut2)
(walk bob location3 location4)
(use_spanner bob spanner1 nut3)
(walk bob shed)
(drop_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used in the `use_spanner` action is always the one that the man is currently carrying. The plan also assumes that the man moves from one location to another using the `walk` action. The order of the actions is important, as the `tighten_nut` action requires a loose nut, and the `useable` predicate is violated once the nut is tightened. The plan also satisfies the given constraints.
