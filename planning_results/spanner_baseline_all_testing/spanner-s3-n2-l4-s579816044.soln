Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location1)
(walk bob location3 location2)
(walk bob location4 location3)
(use spanner1 nut1)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 bob nut1)
(walk bob location2 location4)
(use spanner2 nut2)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 bob nut2)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner used to tighten the nut is the one that is currently being carried by the man. If there's a need to specify which spanner to use, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
