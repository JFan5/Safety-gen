Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan to tighten both nuts can be as follows:

```
(walk bob shed location1)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner1 bob)
(walk bob location2 location3)
(pickup_spanner bob spanner2 bob)
(walk bob location1 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner1 nut1 bob)
(walk bob location2 gate)
(tighten_nut bob spanner2 nut2 bob)
```

This plan assumes that the spanner is useable at both locations, and the nuts are loose at the gate. The plan first moves the man from the shed to location1, picks up spanner1, moves to location2, picks up spanner2, moves to the gate, and finally tightens each nut with the respective spanner.
