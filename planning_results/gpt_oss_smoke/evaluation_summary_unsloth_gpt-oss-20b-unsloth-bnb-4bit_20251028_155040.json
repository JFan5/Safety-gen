      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a plan for the gripper problem. Let's analyze.\n\nDomain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.\n\nPredicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.\n\nActions: move, pick, drop.\n\nGoal: at ball1 room2, ball2 room2, ball3 room4, ball4 room3.\n\nInitial state: robot1 at room1; robot2 at room2. Both robots free in both grippers. ball1 at room2; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room4; ball4 at room1.\n\nWe need to move ball2 from room1 to room2, ball4 from room1 to room3, ball1 already at room2 (goal satisfied), ball3 already at room4 (goal satisfied). So we need to move ball2 to room2 and ball4 to room3.\n\nWe have two robots. They can pick and drop. We need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nWe need to ensure that at the end, ball2 at room2, ball4 at room3.\n\nWe can use robot1 or robot2. Let's think.\n\nRobot1 starts at room1. Robot2 at room2.\n\nGoal: ball2 at room2. Robot2 is already at room2. So robot2 can pick ball2 from room1? Wait ball2 is at room1. Robot2 is at room2, not at room1. So robot2 cannot pick ball2 directly. Robot1 is at room1, can pick ball2.\n\nSimilarly, ball4 at room1. Robot1 can pick ball4.\n\nBut we need to deliver ball4 to room3. So robot1 must move to room3, drop ball4.\n\nAlso ball2 must be moved to room2. Robot1 can pick ball2, move to room2, drop.\n\nBut we need to consider that robot1 cannot carry two objects at once. So we need to pick ball2, move to room2, drop. Then pick ball4, move to room3, drop.\n\nBut we need to ensure that robot1 can move to room3. It starts at room1. It can move to room2, then to room3. But we need to ensure that robot1 is free to move. It has free grippers.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet's outline:\n\nInitial state:\n\n- robot1 at room1\n- robot2 at room2\n- ball1 at room2\n- ball2 at room1\n- ball3 at room4\n- ball4 at room1\n\nGoal: ball2 at room2, ball4 at room3.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. robot1 picks ball2 at room1 with rgripper1 (or lgripper1). Let's choose rgripper1.\n\nAction: pick robot1 ball2 room1 rgripper1\n\nPreconditions: at ball2 room1, at-robby robot1 room1, free robot1 rgripper1. All hold.\n\nEffect: carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1, not at ball2 room1, not free robot1 rgripper1.\n\nNow robot1 carrying ball2.\n\n2. robot1 moves to room2.\n\nAction: move robot1 room1 room2\n\nPrecondition: at-robby robot1 room1. Holds.\n\nEffect: at-robby robot1 room2, not at-robby robot1 room1.\n\nNow robot1 at room2 carrying ball2.\n\n3. robot1 drops ball2 at room2.\n\nAction: drop robot1 ball2 room2 rgripper1\n\nPrecondition: carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1, at-robby robot1 room2. Holds.\n\nEffect: at ball2 room2, free robot1 rgripper1, not carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1.\n\nNow ball2 at room2 as desired.\n\nNow robot1 at room2, free.\n\nNow we need to move ball4 to room3.\n\nRobot1 currently at room2. ball4 at room1. So robot1 must go to room1 to pick ball4.\n\n4. robot1 moves to room1.\n\nAction: move robot1 room2 room1\n\nPrecondition: at-robby robot1 room2. Holds.\n\nEffect: at-robby robot1 room1.\n\nNow robot1 at room1.\n\n5. robot1 picks ball4 at room1 with rgripper1.\n\nAction: pick robot1 ball4 room1 rgripper1\n\nPreconditions: at ball4 room1, at-robby robot1 room1, free robot1 rgripper1. Holds.\n\nEffect: carry robot1 ball4 rgripper1, not at ball4 room1, not free robot1 rgripper1.\n\nNow robot1 carrying ball4.\n\n6. robot1 moves to room3.\n\nBut robot1 is at room1. Need to move to room3. Path: room1 -> room2 -> room3? But we need to check if robot1 can move directly to room3? The domain doesn't specify adjacency. But we can assume any move between rooms is allowed. So we can move directly from room1 to room3.\n\nBut we need to consider that robot1 is at room1. We can do move robot1 room1 room3.\n\nAction: move robot1 room1 room3\n\nPrecondition: at-robby robot1 room1. Holds.\n\nEffect: at-robby robot1 room3, not at-robby robot1 room1.\n\nNow robot1 at room3 carrying ball4.\n\n7. robot1 drops ball4 at room3.\n\nAction: drop robot1 ball4 room3 rgripper1\n\nPrecondition: carry robot1 ball4 rgripper1, at-robby robot1 room3. Holds.\n\nEffect: at ball4 room3, free robot1 rgripper1, not carry robot1 ball4 rgripper1.\n\nNow goal satisfied: ball2 at room2, ball4 at room3. ball1 at room2, ball3 at room4 unchanged.\n\nCheck if any constraints? None.\n\nThus plan is:\n\npick robot1 ball2 room1 rgripper1\nmove robot1 room1 room2\ndrop robot1 ball2 room2 rgripper1\nmove robot1 room2 room1\npick robot1 ball4 room1 rgripper1\nmove robot1 room1 room3\ndrop robot1 ball4 room3 rgripper1\n\nBut we need to ensure that robot1 is free at each step. After dropping ball2, robot1 is free. Good.\n\nNow we need to check that robot1 can move from room2 to room1. Yes.\n\nNow we need to ensure that robot1 can move from room1 to room3. Yes.\n\nNow we need to ensure that robot1 can drop ball4 at room3. Yes.\n\nNow we need to ensure that robot1's gripper is free after dropping ball4. Yes.\n\nNow we need to ensure that robot1's state after dropping ball4 is free.\n\nNow we need to ensure that robot1's final state is at room3, free.\n\nNow we need to ensure that all preconditions hold at each step.\n\nLet's verify each step:\n\nInitial state: robot1 at room1, free rgripper1, free lgripper1, robot2 at room2, free rgripper2, free lgripper2, ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1.\n\nStep 1: pick robot1 ball2 room1 rgripper1\n\nPreconditions: at ball2 room1 (true), at-robby robot1 room1 (true), free robot1 rgripper1 (true). After action: carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1, not at ball2 room1, not free robot1 rgripper1.\n\nState after step 1: robot1 at room1, carrying ball2 with rgripper1, free lgripper1, robot2 at room2, ball1 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1.\n\nStep 2: move robot1 room1 room2\n\nPrecondition: at-robby robot1 room1 (true). After: at-robby robot1 room2, not at-robby robot1 room1.\n\nState: robot1 at room2, carrying ball2, free lgripper1, robot2 at room2, ball1 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1.\n\nStep 3: drop robot1 ball2 room2 rgripper1\n\nPrecondition: carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1 (true), at-robby robot1 room2 (true). After: at ball2 room2, free robot1 rgripper1, not carry robot1 ball2 rgripper1.\n\nState: robot1 at room2, free rgripper1, free lgripper1, robot2 at room2, ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1.\n\nStep 4: move robot1 room2 room1\n\nPrecondition: at-robby robot1 room2 (true). After: at-robby robot1 room1, not at-robby robot1 room2.\n\nState: robot1 at room1, free rgripper1, free lgripper1, robot2 at room2, ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at",
