You are a planning expert. Your task is to generate a **valid plan** for the given domain and problem.
DOMAIN:
(define (domain b...ng as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
```
Great! The output is the plan for the given domain and problem. Let's summarize the plan in a clear and concise manner:
The plan for the given domain and problem is as follows:
1. **Pick up b1**
2. **Put down b1**
3. **Pick up b3**
4. **Put down b3**
5. **Pick up b2**
6. **Put down b2**
7. **Pick up b4**
8. **Put down b4**
9. **Pick up b5**
10. **Put down b5**
11. **Stack b1 on b3**
12. **Stack b3 on b2**
13. **Stack b4 on b5**
This plan ensures that the goal state is achieved while satisfying all the constraints and preconditions of the domain. The plan is valid and satisfies all the requirements of the problem.
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. pickup b1} \\
&\text{2. putdown b1} \\
&\text{3. pickup b3} \\
&\text{4. putdown b3} \\
&\text{5. pickup b2} \\
&\text{6. putdown b2} \\
&\text{7. pickup b4} \\
&\text{8. putdown b4} \\
&\text{9. pickup b5} \\
&\text{10. putdown b5} \\
&\text{11. stack b1 on b3} \\
&\text{12. stack b3 on b2} \\
&\text{13. stack b4 on b5} \\
\end{aligned}
}
