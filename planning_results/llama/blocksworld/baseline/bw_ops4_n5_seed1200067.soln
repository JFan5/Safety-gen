Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pick b3 b1)
(pick b4 b3)
(pick b5 b4)
(unstack b5 b4)
(unstack b4 b3)
(unstack b3 b2)
(unstack b2 b1)
(drop b1 b3)
(drop b3 b4)
(drop b4 b5)
(drop b5 b1)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal and constraints of the problem.
