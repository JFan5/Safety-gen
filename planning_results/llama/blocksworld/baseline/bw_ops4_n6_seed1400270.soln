Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to have b3 on top of b6, b4 on top of b2, and b6 on top of b5. Additionally, we need to ensure that the constraints are satisfied.

Here's a plan that satisfies the goals and constraints:

1. (pick b3)
2. (stack b3 b6)
3. (pick b4)
4. (stack b4 b2)
5. (pick b5)
6. (stack b5 b6)
7. (drop b3)
8. (drop b4)
9. (drop b5)

This plan satisfies the goals and constraints, and it's a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
