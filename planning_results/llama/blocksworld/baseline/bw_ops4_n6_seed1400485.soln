The given problem is a classic example of a planning problem in the domain of Block World. The goal is to move object b4 to the location where object b1 is, and object b2 to the location where object b6 is.

Here is the plan to achieve this goal:

(pick b4 b1)
(pick b2 b6)
(stack b2 b1)
(stack b4 b3)
(unstack b4 b1)
(unstack b2 b6)
(drop b2 b6)
(drop b4 b1)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain. It also satisfies the constraints in the problem statement.
