Here is the plan that meets the requirements:

(pick b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b4)
(stack b4 b5)
(stack b5 b6)
(pick b5)
(drop b5)
(pick b6)
(stack b6 b2)
(unstack b6 b2)
(pick b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(unstack b1 b3)
(drop b1)
(drop b3)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain. It also satisfies the constraints and the initial state.
