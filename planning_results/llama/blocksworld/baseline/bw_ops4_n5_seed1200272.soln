Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move object b2 to the top of the table, and objects b3, b4, and b5 to their respective positions.

Here is the plan:

(pick b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(stack b2 b4)
(stack b2 b5)
(drop b2)
(pick b3)
(stack b3 b4)
(stack b3 b5)
(drop b3)
(pick b4)
(stack b4 b5)
(drop b4)
(pick b5)
(stack b5)
(drop b5)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving objects b2, b3, b4, and b5 to their respective positions on the table.
