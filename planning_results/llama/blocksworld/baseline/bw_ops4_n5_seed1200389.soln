Here's the plan to solve the problem:

(pick b1 b2)
(pick b3 b1)
(pick b4 b3)
(pick b5 b4)
(stack b5 b4)
(stack b4 b3)
(stack b3 b1)
(unstack b3 b1)
(unstack b4 b3)
(unstack b5 b4)

This plan follows the rules and constraints provided in the problem. It starts with picking up the objects, then stacks and unstacks them in the correct order to achieve the goal.
