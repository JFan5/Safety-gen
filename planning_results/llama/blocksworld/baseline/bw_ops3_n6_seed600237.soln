Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, let's validate the initial state:

- The problem states that the initial state should satisfy the following conditions:
  - (on b1 b4)
  - (on-table b2)
  - (on b3 b1)
  - (on b4 b6)
  - (on-table b5)
  - (on b6 b5)
  - (clear b2)
  - (clear b3)

- The initial state satisfies all these conditions.

Since the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, the output will be nothing.

Output:
```
```

Note that the output is empty because the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints.
