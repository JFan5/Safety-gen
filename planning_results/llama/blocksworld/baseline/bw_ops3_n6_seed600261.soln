Using the provided planning rules, we can generate a plan to solve the given problem.

The initial state is:
```
(arm-empty)
(on b1 b3)
(on-table b2)
(on b3 b2)
(on-table b4)
(on b5 b6)
(on b6 b4)
(clear b1)
(clear b5)
```
The goal is:
```
(and
(on b1 b3)
(on b2 b4)
(on b3 b2)
(on b4 b5)
(on-table b5)
(on-table b6))
```
The constraints are:
```
(sometime-before (on b2 b4) (on b1 b3))
```
To satisfy the constraints, we need to ensure that the action `pick b1` comes before the action `pick b2`.

Here is the plan:
```
(pick b1 b3)
(pick b2 b4)
(unstack b1 b3)
(unstack b2 b4)
(stack b5 b6)
(stack b6 b4)
```
This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and also satisfies the constraints.

Therefore, the final output is:
```
(pick b1 b3)
(pick b2 b4)
(unstack b1 b3)
(unstack b2 b4)
(stack b5 b6)
(stack b6 b4)
```
