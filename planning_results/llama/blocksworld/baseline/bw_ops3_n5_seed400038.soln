Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state is:
(arm-empty)
(on b1 b5)
(on b2 b1)
(on-table b3)
(on b4 b2)
(on-table b5)
(clear b3)
(clear b4)

The goal is:
(and
(on b1 b3)
(on b2 b5)
(on-table b3)
(on b4 b1)
(on-table b5))

The constraints are:
(sometime-before (on b2 b5) (on b1 b3))

Here is the plan:

(pick b1 b3)
(stack b1 b2)
(pick b2 b5)
(unstack b2 b1)
(stack b1 b4)
(pick b4 b1)
(drop b4 b2)
(stack b2 b5)
(drop b2 b1)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b1 b5)
(pick b5 b3)
(stack b5 b4)
(drop b5 b1)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b1 b5)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
