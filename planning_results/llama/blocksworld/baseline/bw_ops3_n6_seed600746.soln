Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

(pick b1 b6)
(stack b1 b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(stack b3 b4)
(stack b4 b5)
(stack b5 b2)
(unstack b5 b2)
(unstack b2 b3)
(unstack b3 b4)
(unstack b4 b5)
(pickup b5)
(drop b5)
(drop b4)
(drop b3)
(drop b2)
(drop b1)
(putdown b1)
(putdown b5)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain, and it also satisfies the goal and constraints of the problem.
