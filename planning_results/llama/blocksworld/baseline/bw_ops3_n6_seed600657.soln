Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

First, we need to satisfy the constraints:

* (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b3))

This constraint implies that b2 must be on the table before b1 is on b3. We can satisfy this by moving b2 to the table and then moving b1 to b3.

Next, we need to satisfy the goal:

* (and (on b1 b3) (on-table b2) (on b3 b2) (on b4 b5) (on b5 b6) (on b6 b1))

We can satisfy this by moving b2 to the table, b1 to b3, b4 to b5, b5 to b6, and b6 to b1.

Here is the final plan:

(move b2)
(move b1 b3)
(move b4 b5)
(move b5 b6)
(move b6 b1)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
