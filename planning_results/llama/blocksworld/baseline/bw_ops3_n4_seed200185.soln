The problem is to produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given domain and problem. 

First, let's analyze the problem:

The goal is to move object b1 to object b2, and at the same time, move object b4 to object b1.

The initial state is:
- The arm is empty.
- Object b1 is on the table.
- Object b2 is on object b1.
- Object b3 is on the table.
- Object b4 is on object b2.

The constraints are:
- There is a constraint that object b2 must be on the table before object b1 is on object b2.

Now, let's generate a plan:

1. Pick up object b1.
2. Stack object b1 on object b2.
3. Put down object b1.
4. Move object b1 to object b2.

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the constraints. 

Therefore, the final output is:

(pick a b)
(stack a b b4)
(drop a b)
(move a b)
