Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b4)
(pick b2 b5)
(stack b2 b1)
(stack b3 b5)
(stack b4 b3)
(unstack b4 b2)
(unstack b5 b3)
(drop b1 b3)
(drop b2 b5)
(drop b4 b2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal and constraints of the problem.
