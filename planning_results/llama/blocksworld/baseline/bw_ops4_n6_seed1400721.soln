Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state is:
(arm-empty)
(on-table b1)
(on b2 b5)
(on b3 b4)
(on-table b4)
(on b5 b6)
(on-table b6)
(clear b1)
(clear b2)
(clear b3)

The goal is:
(and
(on b1 b2)
(on b2 b6)
(on b3 b4)
(on b5 b1))

The constraints are:
(sometime-before (on b2 b6) (on b1 b2))

Here is the plan:

(pick b1)
(stack b1 b2)
(on b2 b6)
(unstack b2 b6)
(pick b5)
(stack b5 b1)
(unstack b5 b1)
(drop b5)
(drop b3)
(pick b4)
(stack b4 b3)
(unstack b4 b3)
(drop b4)
(drop b1)
(drop b2)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints.
