Based on the given domain, problem, and planning rules, I'll generate a plan that satisfies the conditions.

Since there are no constraints in the problem, I'll focus on achieving the goal state.

The goal is to have b1 on table, b2 on b3, b3 on b5, and b5 on b2.

Here's a grounded plan to achieve this:

(pick b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(on b3 b5)
(pick b5)
(unstack b5 b3)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(on b3 b5)
(unstack b3 b5)
(pick b4)
(drop b4 b3)
(pick b3)
(unstack b3 b5)
(stack b3 b2)
(on b2 b5)
(pick b5)
(unstack b5 b3)
(drop b5 b2)

Here is the output of the plan, one step per line:

(pick b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(on b3 b5)
(pick b5)
(unstack b5 b3)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(on b3 b5)
(unstack b3 b5)
(pick b4)
(drop b4 b3)
(pick b3)
(unstack b3 b5)
(stack b3 b2)
(on b2 b5)
(pick b5)
(unstack b5 b3)
(drop b5 b2)

Note that the plan is a sequence of actions that will ultimately satisfy the goal state.
