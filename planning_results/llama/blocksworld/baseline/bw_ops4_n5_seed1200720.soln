Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to have b2 on top of b3, b4 on top of b2, and b5 on top of b1.

The constraints are that sometime before b4 is on top of b2, b2 is on top of b3.

Here's a plan that satisfies these conditions:

(pick b2 b3)
(pick b4 b2)
(pick b5 b1)
(stack b2 b4)
(stack b3 b5)
(stack b4 b5)
(stack b5 b1)
(stack b1 b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(drop b2 b3)
(drop b4 b2)
(drop b5 b1)

This plan ensures that all preconditions are met, and all constraints are satisfied.
