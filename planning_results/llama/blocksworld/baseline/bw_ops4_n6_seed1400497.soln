Here is the plan that satisfies the given problem:

(pick b1 b4)
(pick b2 b6)
(stack b2 b1)
(stack b5 b3)
(stack b4 b2)
(unstack b4 b2)
(unstack b5 b3)
(unstack b6 b1)
(drop b6 b4)
(drop b1 b2)
(drop b3 b5)

This plan satisfies the goal of having b2 on top of b6, b3 on top of b5, and b4 on top of b2, while also satisfying the constraints that the action on b3 must come before the action on b5.
