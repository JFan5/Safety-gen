Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move object b1 to object b2, then move object b2 to object b3, and finally move object b6 to object b1.

Here is the plan:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(unstack b1 b2)
(pick b6 b1)
(stack b1 b6)
(unstack b6 b1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
