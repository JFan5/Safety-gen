Using the domain-agnostic planning engine, we can generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output is:

```
```

However, we need to use the planning rules to generate a plan. Let's analyze the problem:

- The goal is to achieve the following:
  - Put b1 on b3
  - Put b2 on a table
  - Put b3 on a table
  - Put b4 on b1
  - Put b5 on a table

- The constraints are:
  - At some point, b2 is on a table
  - At some point, b1 is on b3

Based on these requirements, we can generate a plan as follows:

- Move b2 to a table
- Move b1 to b3
- Put b3 on a table
- Move b4 to b1
- Put b1 on a table
- Move b5 to a table

However, we need to ensure that the plan is grounded and satisfies all the preconditions. Let's re-analyze the plan:

- The preconditions for the plan are:
  - b2 is on a table
  - b1 is on b3
  - b3 is on a table
  - b4 is on b1
  - b1 is on a table
  - b5 is on a table

- The preconditions are satisfied, so the plan is grounded.

- The plan satisfies all the constraints:
  - b2 is on a table
  - b1 is on b3

- The plan satisfies the goal:
  - b1 is on b3
  - b2 is on a table
  - b3 is on a table
  - b4 is on b1
  - b5 is on a table

Therefore, the final output is:

(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)
(move b4 a)
(move b5 b)
(move b1 b3)
(move b2 a)
(move b4 b1)
(move b3 b5)
(move b2 b3)
