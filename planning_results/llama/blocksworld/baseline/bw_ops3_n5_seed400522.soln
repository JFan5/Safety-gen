Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b1 b3)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b3 b5)
(unstack b3 b4)
(stack b3 b2)
(pick b2 b1)
(pick b1 b4)
(drop b1 b4)
(drop b1 b2)
(drop b1 b3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal and constraints of the problem.
