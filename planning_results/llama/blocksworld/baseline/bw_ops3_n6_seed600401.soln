Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, we can generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

The constraint "sometime-before (on b2 b5) (on b1 b3)" implies that b2 must be on b5 before b1 is on b3. We can satisfy this constraint by moving b2 to b5 first.

Here is the plan:

(pick b2 b5)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b2 b5)
(drop b1 b3)

This plan satisfies the constraint and the goals, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.

The final output will be:

(pick b2 b5)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b2 b5)
(drop b1 b3)
