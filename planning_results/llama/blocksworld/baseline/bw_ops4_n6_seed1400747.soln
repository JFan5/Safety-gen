Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move b3 to b1, b4 to b3, and b5 to b2. The constraints are that sometime before b4 is on b3, b3 must be on b1.

Here is the plan:

(pick b3 b1)
(stack b3 b4)
(unstack b3 b1)
(pick b4 b3)
(stack b4 b5)
(unstack b4 b3)
(pick b5 b2)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables, timestamps, or durations.
