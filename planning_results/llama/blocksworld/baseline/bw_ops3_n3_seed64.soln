Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to have b1 on the table, b2 on top of b1, and b3 on top of b2. Additionally, there is a constraint that b2 must be on top of b1 before b3 is on top of b2.

Here is the plan:

(pick b1)
(stack b1 b2)
(drop b1)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(drop b2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraint, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
