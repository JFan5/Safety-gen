Here is the plan that satisfies the given conditions:

(pick b1 b2)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b3 b2)
(stack b4 b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(stack b2 b4)
(pick b1 b4)
(pick b2 b3)
(unstack b1 b4)
(unstack b2 b3)
(drop b2 b3)
(drop b3 b4)
(drop b4 b1)
(drop b1 b2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints specified in the problem, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
