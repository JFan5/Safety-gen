Here is the plan that satisfies the given problem:

(pick b1 b3)
(pick b4 b2)
(pick b5 b4)
(stack b6 b5)
(stack b1 b6)
(drop b1 b3)
(drop b4 b2)
(drop b5 b4)

This plan satisfies the goal of having b1 on top of b3, b4 on top of b2, and b5 on top of b4, and also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
