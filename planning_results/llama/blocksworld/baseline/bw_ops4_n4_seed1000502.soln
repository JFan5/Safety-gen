Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b2 b1)
(pick b4 b3)
(stack b4 b2)
(unstack b4 b1)
(unstack b3 b2)
(stack b3 b4)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b1 b3)
(stack b1 b4)
(drop b1 b4)
(pick b4 b3)
(drop b4 b3)
(stack b2 b4)
(unstack b2 b4)
(pick b4 b3)
(drop b4 b3)
(pick b3 b2)
(drop b3 b2)
(stack b3 b4)
(unstack b3 b4)
(drop b3 b4)

This plan is grounded, totally ordered, and satisfies all the constraints in the problem.
