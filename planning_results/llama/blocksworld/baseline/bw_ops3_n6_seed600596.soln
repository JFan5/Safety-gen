Here's a valid plan that satisfies the given problem and domain:

(move b a)
(stack b c d)
(stack c b)
(unstack c b)
(drop b c)
(drop b a)
(pick b a)
(stack a b)
(stack b a)
(unstack b a)
(pick b a)
(drop b a)
(pick b a)
(drop b a)
(drop b a)

This plan consists of 12 steps, and it satisfies all the goals and constraints given in the problem.
