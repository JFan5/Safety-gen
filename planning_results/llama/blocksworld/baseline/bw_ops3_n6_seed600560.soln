Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

The problem is to pick up object b1, move it to object b6, put it down, pick up object b2, move it to object b3, put it down, pick up object b3, move it to object b4, put it down, pick up object b4, move it to object b1, put it down, pick up object b5, move it to object b2, put it down, and finally pick up object b2.

Here is the plan:

(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b6)
(putdown b1)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(putdown b2)
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b4)
(putdown b3)
(pickup b4)
(stack b4 b1)
(putdown b4)
(pickup b5)
(stack b5 b2)
(putdown b5)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving b1 to b6, b2 to b3, b3 to b4, and b4 to b1.
