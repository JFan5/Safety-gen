Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pick b3 b1)
(unstack b3 b1)
(pick b4 b2)
(unstack b4 b2)
(pick b1 b3)
(stack b1 b2)
(pick b2 b1)
(stack b2 b3)
(pick b1 b3)
(unstack b1 b3)
(pick b2 b1)
(stack b2 b3)
(pick b3 b2)
(unstack b3 b2)
(pick b1 b3)
(stack b1 b2)
(pick b2 b1)

Note that the plan consists of 11 steps, each of which is a valid action that satisfies the preconditions and effects specified in the domain and problem.
