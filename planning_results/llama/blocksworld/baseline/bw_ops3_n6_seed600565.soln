I can help you with this problem. However, I need to clarify that the provided problem is a PDDL2 (Planning Domain Definition Language 2) problem, and the solution involves generating a plan using a PDDL2 planning engine.

Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to execute PDDL2 planning engines. However, I can guide you through the process of generating a plan using the provided domain and problem.

Here's the plan:
(pick a b)
(stack a b c)
(unstack b c)
(pick b)
(putdown b)
(stack b c)
(pick b)
(pickup b)

Please note that this plan is generated manually using the provided domain and problem, and it may not be the optimal solution. A PDDL2 planning engine would be able to generate a more efficient plan.
