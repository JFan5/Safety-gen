Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b4 b1)
(unstack b1 b2)
(unstack b3 b4)
(drop b3)
(drop b4)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints of the problem, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
