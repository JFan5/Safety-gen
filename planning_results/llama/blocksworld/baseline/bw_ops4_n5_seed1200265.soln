Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b1 b3)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b3 b5)
(pick b5 b2)
(unstack b5 b2)
(unstack b3 b4)
(stack b3 b1)
(pick b1 b3)
(drop b1 b3)
(drop b1 b2)
(drop b1 b5)
(drop b1 b4)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having b1 on b3, b2 on b1, b3 on b4, and b4 on b5.
