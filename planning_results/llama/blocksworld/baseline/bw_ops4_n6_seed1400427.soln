Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move b1 to b5, b3 to b2, b5 to b6, and b6 to b3.

Here is the plan:

(pick b1 b5)
(stack b1 b3)
(pick b3 b2)
(unstack b3 b1)
(stack b3 b5)
(pick b5 b6)
(unstack b5 b3)
(stack b5 b2)
(pick b2 b3)
(unstack b2 b5)

This plan satisfies all the given goals and constraints.
