Let's break down the problem and constraints to determine the final plan.

Goal:
(on b1 b4)
(on b3 b1)
(on b4 b5)
(on b5 b2)

Constraints:
(sometime-before (on b3 b1) (on b1 b4))

Preconditions and Effects:
All actions are grounded and sequenced.

1. Pickup b3
2. Stack b4 b3
3. Pickup b5
4. Stack b4 b5
5. Pickup b2
6. Stack b5 b2

Here is the plan:
(pickup b3)
(stack b4 b3)
(pickup b5)
(stack b4 b5)
(pickup b2)
(stack b5 b2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints.
