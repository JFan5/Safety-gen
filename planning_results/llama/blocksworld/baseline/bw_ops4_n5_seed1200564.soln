Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move b4 to b1, b2 to b4, and b5 to b3. The constraints are that b4 must be on b2 before b4 is on b1.

Here is the plan:

(pick b4 b2)
(pick b2 b4)
(drop b4 b2)
(pick b4 b1)
(drop b4 b2)
(pick b4 b3)
(drop b4 b1)
(pick b4 b2)
(drop b4 b1)
(pick b4 b3)
(drop b4 b1)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
