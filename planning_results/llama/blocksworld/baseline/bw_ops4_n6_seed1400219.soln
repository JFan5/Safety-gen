Using the provided domain and problem, I'll generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

Here's the plan:

(pick b1 b)
(pick b2 b)
(stack b2 b1 b)
(stack b3 b5 b)
(stack b4 b1 b)
(unstack b4 b1 b)
(unstack b3 b5 b)
(drop b2 b)
(drop b6 b)
(drop b5 b)
(drop b4 b)
(drop b1 b)
(drop b3 b)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain, and it also satisfies the goal and constraints specified in the problem.
