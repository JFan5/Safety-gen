Here is the plan that satisfies the given problem:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b4 b5)
(pick b5 b6)
(stack b6 b1)
(pick b1 b3)
(unstack b3 b4)
(unstack b4 b5)
(unstack b5 b6)
(drop b2)
(drop b3)
(drop b4)
(drop b5)
(drop b6)
(drop b1)

This plan satisfies the goal of having b1 on top of b3, b2 on top of b4, b3 on top of b5, and b6 on top of b1, and also satisfies the constraint that b2 is below b4.
