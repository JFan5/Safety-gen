Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b3)
(pick b3 b4)
(stack b4 b1)
(drop b1)
(drop b2)
(drop b3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having all objects on the table.
