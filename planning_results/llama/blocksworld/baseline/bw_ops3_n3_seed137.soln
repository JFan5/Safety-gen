The plan is as follows:

(pick b1 b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(pick b3 b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(pick b2 b3)
(unstack b2 b3)
(unstack b1 b3)
(drop b1)
(drop b2)
(drop b3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having b1 on a table, b2 on b3, and b3 on b1.
