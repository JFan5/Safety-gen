Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state is:
(arm-empty)
(on b1 b2)
(on b2 b4)
(on b3 b1)
(on-table b4)
(clear b3)

The goal is:
(and
(on b1 b3)
(on-table b2)
(on-table b3)
(on b4 b1))

The constraints are:
(sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b3))

Here is the plan:

(pick b3)
(stack b3 b1)
(unstack b3 b1)
(drop b3)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b4)
(unstack b2 b4)
(drop b2)
(pick b4)
(stack b4 b1)
(unstack b4 b1)
(drop b4)
(pick b1)
(stack b1 b3)
(unstack b1 b3)
(drop b1)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints.
