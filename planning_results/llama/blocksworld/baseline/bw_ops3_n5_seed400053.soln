Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to have b1 on a table, b2 on b4, and b3 on b5. Additionally, there is a constraint that b2 must be on the table before b1.

Here is the plan:

(pick b1)
(pick b2)
(stack b2 b1)
(stack b3 b5)
(pick b3)
(pick b4)
(stack b4 b5)
(stack b3 b4)
(drop b3)
(drop b4)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
