Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos0-4 and the key1 to pos4-1.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos2-3 shape0)
(move pos2-3 pos0-4)
(pick pos0-4 key0)
(move pos0-4 pos4-1)
(pick pos4-1 key1)
(move pos4-1 pos4-4)
(pick pos4-4 key2)
(move pos4-4 pos4-1)
(drop pos4-1 key2)
(drop pos4-4 key2)
(drop pos4-1 key1)
(drop pos0-4 key0)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
