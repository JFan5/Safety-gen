Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to move the key2 to the position pos4-0.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos1-3 shape0)
(unlock pos4-4 shape1)
(move pos4-0 pos4-2)
(at key2 pos4-0)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints.
