To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the planning rules:

- The problem is to move the key from position 2-3 to position 2-1.
- The planning rules state that we should only use available symbols, respect typing, and satisfy any constraints.
- The constraints include the invariant that the robot cannot be at position 2-0.

Based on this analysis, we can generate a plan as follows:

1. (unlock pos3-3)
2. (unlock key1)
3. (move key1 pos2-1)
4. (move pos3-3 pos2-1)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the key from position 2-3 to position 2-1, while also satisfying the constraints and respecting the typing of the symbols.

Here is the final output:

(unlock pos3-3)
(unlock key1)
(move key1 pos2-1)
(move pos3-3 pos2-1)
