To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, we need to validate the initial state and ensure that all action preconditions hold in the current state.

Next, we need to generate a plan that satisfies the goal and all constraints.

Here is the plan:
(unlock pos1-2 shape0)
(unlock pos3-1 shape1)
(move pos1-2)
(move pos3-1)
(pick pos3-1)
(pick pos1-2)
(drop pos1-2)
(drop pos3-1)
(pick pos3-1)
(drop pos3-1)
(move pos3-1)
(move pos1-2)
(drop pos1-2)
(drop pos3-1)

Note that this plan satisfies the goal of moving the key to the correct position and also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
