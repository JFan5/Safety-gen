To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem:

* The goal is to move the key0 to pos1-3 and the key1 to pos2-0.
* The constraints include the invariant that the robot cannot be at pos2-1.

Since the goal is to move the key0 to pos1-3 and the key1 to pos2-0, we can start by moving the key0 to pos1-3.

1. (unlock pos0-0 shape0)
2. (unlock pos4-0 shape1)
3. (unlock pos3-0 shape2)
4. (move pos0-0 pos1-3)
5. (pickup pos1-3 key0)
6. (move pos1-3 pos2-0)
7. (pickup pos2-0 key1)

Now, let's check if the plan satisfies the constraints:

* The robot is not at pos2-1, so the invariant is satisfied.

Therefore, the final output is:

1. (unlock pos0-0 shape0)
2. (unlock pos4-0 shape1)
3. (unlock pos3-0 shape2)
4. (move pos0-0 pos1-3)
5. (pickup pos1-3 key0)
6. (move pos1-3 pos2-0)
7. (pickup pos2-0 key1)
