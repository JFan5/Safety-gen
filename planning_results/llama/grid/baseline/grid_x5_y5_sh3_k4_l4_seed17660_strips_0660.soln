Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key3 to the position 2-1.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(at key3 pos2-1)
(unlock pos1-4 key3 shape2)
(move pos1-4 pos2-1)
(lock-shape pos1-4 shape2)
(at key3 pos2-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and is a grounded, totally-ordered sequence of actions.
