To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, we need to validate the initial state. We can see that the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints.

Since the task is satisfiable, we can proceed to generate a plan.

Here is the plan:
(move pos4-4)
(unlock pos4-1 pos3-4 key0)
(unlock pos4-2 pos3-3 key1)
(move pos3-3)
(move pos3-4)
(drop pos3-4)

The final output is:
(move pos4-4)
(unlock pos4-1 pos3-4 key0)
(unlock pos4-2 pos3-3 key1)
(move pos3-3)
(move pos3-4)
(drop pos3-4)
