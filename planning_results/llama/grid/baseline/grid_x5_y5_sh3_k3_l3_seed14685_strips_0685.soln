Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos0-3, and the key1 to pos4-4.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos0-3 key0 shape0)
(move pos0-3 pos1-2)
(pick key1 pos3-3)
(move pos1-3 pos4-4)
(pick key0 pos0-3)
(drop key0 pos0-1)
(drop key1 pos4-4)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
