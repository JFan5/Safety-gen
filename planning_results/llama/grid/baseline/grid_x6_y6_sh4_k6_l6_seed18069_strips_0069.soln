Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos1-3 and the key5 to the position pos1-0.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints.

Therefore, the output will be:

NO-PLAN
