Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, I will still provide the plan that satisfies the constraints:

(locked pos4-4)
(lock-shape  pos4-4 shape0)
(lock-shape  pos5-5 shape1)
(lock-shape  pos0-1 shape2)
(open pos0-0)
(open pos0-2)
(open pos0-3)
(open pos0-4)
(open pos0-5)
(open pos1-0)
(open pos1-2)
(open pos1-3)
(open pos1-4)
(open pos1-5)
(open pos2-0)
(open pos2-1)
(open pos2-2)
(open pos2-3)
(open pos2-4)
(open pos2-5)
(open pos3-0)
(open pos3-1)
(open pos3-2)
(open pos3-3)
(open pos3-4)
(open pos3-5)
(at key0 pos4-2)
(at key1 pos4-5)
(at key2 pos4-2)
(at key3 pos5-2)

Note that this plan is not the optimal one, but it satisfies the constraints and goals.

The final output is:

(locked pos4-4)
(lock-shape  pos4-4 shape0)
(lock-shape  pos5-5 shape1)
(lock-shape  pos0-1 shape2)
(open pos0-0)
(open pos0-2)
(open pos0-3)
(open pos0-4)
(open pos0-5)
(open pos1-0)
(open pos1-2)
(open pos1-3)
(open pos1-4)
(open pos1-5)
(open pos2-0)
(open pos2-1)
(open pos2-2)
(open pos2-3)
(open pos2-4)
(open pos2-5)
(open pos3-0)
(open pos3-1)
(open pos3-2)
(open pos3-3)
(open pos3-4)
(open pos3-5)
(at key0 pos4-2)
(at key1 pos4-5)
(at key2 pos4-2)
(at key3 pos5-2)
