Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (unlock pos3-2 shape0)
2. (unlock pos3-3 shape1)
3. (unlock pos1-1 shape2)
4. (unlock pos0-5 shape0)
5. (unlock pos0-4 shape0)
6. (unlock pos1-5 shape1)
7. (unlock pos1-4 shape2)
8. (unlock pos1-3 shape1)
9. (unlock pos1-2 shape2)
10. (unlock pos1-1 shape1)
11. (unlock pos1-0 shape2)
12. (unlock pos2-0 shape3)
13. (unlock pos2-1 shape3)
14. (unlock pos2-5 shape3)
15. (unlock pos3-0 shape3)
16. (unlock pos3-1 shape3)
17. (unlock pos3-4 shape3)
18. (unlock pos3-5 shape3)
19. (unlock pos4-1 shape3)
20. (unlock pos4-2 shape3)
21. (unlock pos4-3 shape3)
22. (unlock pos4-4 shape3)
23. (unlock pos4-5 shape3)
24. (unlock pos5-1 shape3)
25. (unlock pos5-2 shape3)
26. (unlock pos5-3 shape3)
27. (unlock pos5-4 shape3)
28. (unlock pos5-5 shape3)

However, the problem statement does not specify any actions to be performed. Therefore, the plan should be empty.

The final output is:

NO-PLAN
