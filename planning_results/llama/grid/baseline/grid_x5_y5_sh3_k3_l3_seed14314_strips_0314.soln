Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

The goal is to move the key2 to the position pos0-0.

Here is the plan:

(at key2 pos4-2)
(unlock pos2-2 shape1 pos0-0)
(move pos0-0 pos2-2)
(at key2 pos0-0)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints.
