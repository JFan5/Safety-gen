Based on the provided domain, problem, and planning rules, I will attempt to generate a plan.

After analyzing the problem, I noticed that the goal is to move the key0 to pos1-4 and the key3 to pos5-5. However, the key3 is already at pos5-5, so we can't move it. We can only move the key0 to pos1-4.

Here's a possible plan:

(move key0 pos1-4)
(at key0 pos1-4)
(at-robot pos5-3)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints. However, since the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints, the output should be nothing.

Therefore, the final output is:

(no output)
