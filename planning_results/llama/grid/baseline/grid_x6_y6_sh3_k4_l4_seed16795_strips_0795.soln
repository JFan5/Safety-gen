Based on the provided domain and problem, the goal is to move the key1 to the position pos4-3.

Here's a possible plan:

(lock-shape  pos5-1 shape0)
(lock-shape  pos4-2 shape1)
(move pos5-1 pos4-2)
(at-robot pos4-3)
(move pos4-2 pos4-3)
(at key1 pos4-3)

This plan first locks the shape1 at pos5-1, then moves the key1 to pos4-2, moves the key1 to pos4-3, and finally moves the key1 to its final position at pos4-3.

Note that this plan satisfies the goal and the constraints of the problem.
