Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to the position 2-0, and the key2 to the position 2-1.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos0-2 shape0)
(unlock pos4-0 shape1)
(move pos4-0 pos2-0)
(move pos1-4 pos2-1)
(pick pos2-1 key2)
(drop pos2-1 key0)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
