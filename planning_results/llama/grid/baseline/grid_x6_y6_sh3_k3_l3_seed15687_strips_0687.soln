Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position 5-2 and the key2 to the position 3-0.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos1-4 key1 shape2)
(move pos1-4 pos5-2)
(unlock pos2-3 key2 shape1)
(move pos2-3 pos3-0)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.
