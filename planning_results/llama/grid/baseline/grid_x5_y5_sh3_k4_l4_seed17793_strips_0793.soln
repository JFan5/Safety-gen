To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, I'll analyze the problem and generate a plan that satisfies all the conditions.

The problem is to move the key0 to the position pos0-4, key2 to the position pos1-2, and key3 to the position pos0-0.

Here's a plan that achieves this:

1. (unlock pos0-3 shape0)
2. (unlock pos2-0 shape1)
3. (unlock pos2-2 shape2)
4. (move key0 pos0-4)
5. (move key2 pos1-2)
6. (move key3 pos0-0)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving the keys to their respective positions.

So, the final output is:

1. (unlock pos0-3 shape0)
2. (unlock pos2-0 shape1)
3. (unlock pos2-2 shape2)
4. (move key0 pos0-4)
5. (move key2 pos1-2)
6. (move key3 pos0-0)

Note that this plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the constraints and goals of the problem.
