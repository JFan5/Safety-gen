Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos3-2.

The constraints are:
- Always (not (at-robot pos2-2))

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos3-2)
(pick key1 pos3-2)
(drop key1 pos3-2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and only uses available symbols.
