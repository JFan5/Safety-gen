Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key2 to the position pos1-4.

The constraints are:
- always (not (at-robot pos1-3))

Here is the plan:

(at-robot pos2-3)
(move pos2-3 pos1-4)
(at key2 pos1-4)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
