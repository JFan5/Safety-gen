To solve this problem, we need to follow the planning rules provided. We have a domain and a problem, and we need to find a plan to satisfy the goal.

The goal is to have the key0 at pos3-4, and the key1 at pos2-1. We also have constraints that the robot should not be at pos3-2.

We can start by moving the key0 to pos3-4, and then move the key1 to pos2-1.

Here is the plan:

(move key0 pos3-4)
(move key1 pos2-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and the constraints. Therefore, the final output is:

(move key0 pos3-4)
(move key1 pos2-1)
