To produce the final output, I will use the provided planning rules and the given problem to generate a plan.

First, I will check the initial state and the constraints to see if the plan can be satisfied. Since there are no constraints provided in the problem, I will proceed with the goal-directed PDDL2 task.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos0-0 and the key2 to pos0-0.

The plan is as follows:

1. (unlock pos0-0 key0 shape0)
2. (move pos0-0 pos0-0)
3. (unlock pos0-2 key2 shape1)
4. (move pos0-2 pos0-0)
5. (pickup key2)
6. (move pos0-0 pos0-0)
7. (putdown key2)

However, this plan does not satisfy the constraint that the robot should not be at pos0-2. Therefore, I will remove the third action from the plan.

The updated plan is as follows:

1. (unlock pos0-0 key0 shape0)
2. (move pos0-0 pos0-0)
3. (pickup key2)
4. (move pos0-0 pos0-0)
5. (putdown key2)

This plan satisfies the goal and the constraint, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.

The final output is:

(move pos0-0 pos0-0)
(pickup key2)
(move pos0-0 pos0-0)
(putdown key2)
