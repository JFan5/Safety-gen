Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos3-3 key1)
(unlock pos0-0 key0)
(pick key2)
(move key2 pos3-3)
(move key0 pos2-3)
(move key1 pos0-3)
(move key0 pos2-1)
(move key1 pos0-1)
(drop key2 pos3-3)
(drop key0 pos2-3)
(drop key1 pos0-3)

This plan satisfies the given conditions and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
