Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos0-4, and the key1 to pos4-1.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos0-4 key0 shape0)
(move pos0-4 pos1-2)
(pick key1 pos1-2)
(move pos1-2 pos4-1)
(pick key0 pos4-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
