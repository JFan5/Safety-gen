Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

The goal is to move the key0 to the position pos1-0.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos4-2 shape0)
(unlock pos4-3 shape1)
(move pos4-2 pos1-0)
(move pos4-3 pos3-1)
(move pos4-2 pos1-0)

This plan first unlocks the shape0 at pos4-2 and pos4-3, then moves the key0 to pos1-0.

Please note that this plan is based on the provided domain and problem, and it may not be the only possible solution.
