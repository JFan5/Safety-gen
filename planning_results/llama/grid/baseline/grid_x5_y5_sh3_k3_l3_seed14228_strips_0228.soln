Based on the provided domain and problem, the goal is to move the key1 to the position pos4-4. Here is the plan:

(unlock pos0-2 shape0)
(unlock pos0-3 shape0)
(move pos0-2 pos1-2)
(move pos0-3 pos1-3)
(move pos1-2 pos4-2)
(move pos1-3 pos4-3)
(move pos1-4 pos4-4)
(pick pos4-4 key1)
(drop pos4-4 key1)
(move pos4-4 pos4-4)
(pick pos4-4 key1)
(drop pos4-4 key1)

Note: The plan involves unlocking the shape0 and shape2, which are locked at the positions pos0-2 and pos0-3 respectively. The key1 is then moved to the position pos4-4, picked up, and then dropped back to pos4-4 to satisfy the goal.
