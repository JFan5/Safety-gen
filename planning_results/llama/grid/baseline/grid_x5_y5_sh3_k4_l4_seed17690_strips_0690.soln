Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key to the location where it can be picked up by the robot.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos1-1 shape0 key0)
(move pos1-1 pos3-4)
(pick pos3-4 key0)
(move pos3-4 pos1-2)
(pick pos1-2 key0)
(move pos1-2 pos0-3)
(pick pos0-3 key0)
(move pos0-3 pos2-1)
(pick pos2-1 key0)
(move pos2-1 pos4-2)
(pick pos4-2 key0)
(move pos4-2 pos4-3)
(pick pos4-3 key0)
(move pos4-3 pos3-4)
(drop pos3-4 key0)
(drop pos4-3 key0)
(drop pos4-2 key0)
(drop pos0-3 key0)
(drop pos1-2 key0)
(drop pos1-1 key0)
(drop pos2-1 key0)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the key to the location where it can be picked up by the robot.
