Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to the position pos2-3, and the key1 to the position pos2-0.

Here is the plan:

(move key0 pos2-3)
(move key1 pos2-0)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.

Output:
(move key0 pos2-3)
(move key1 pos2-0)
