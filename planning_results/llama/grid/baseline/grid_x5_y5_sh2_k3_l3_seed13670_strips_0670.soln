Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos4-3 and the key2 to the position pos4-3.

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos4-3)
(move key2 pos4-3)

This plan satisfies the goal and does not violate any constraints.

The final output is:

(move key1 pos4-3)
(move key2 pos4-3)
