Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (unlock pos1-3 shape0)
2. (unlock pos0-2 shape1)
3. (unlock pos0-0 shape2)
4. (unlock pos2-0 shape3)
5. (unlock pos4-1 shape0)
6. (unlock pos5-0 shape2)
7. (move pos5-2 key2)
8. (move pos2-1 key3)
9. (move pos3-3 key5)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the key2 to pos5-2, key3 to pos2-1, and key5 to pos3-3, while also satisfying the constraints and invariants implied by the domain and problem.
