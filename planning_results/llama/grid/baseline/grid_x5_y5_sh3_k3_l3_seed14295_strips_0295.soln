Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos4-0, and the key1 to pos0-2. The constraints are that the robot cannot move to pos3-2.

Here is the plan:

(move key0 pos4-0)
(pick key1 pos0-2)
(move key1 pos0-2)
(move key0 pos4-0)

This plan satisfies the goals and constraints, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.
