To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input provided, I will follow the planning rules and output requirements specified.

Given the problem:

    ))
    (:constraints
      (always (not (at-robot pos2-1)))
    )
)
</PROBLEM>
```

Given the problem and constraints, the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints. Therefore, there is no need to perform any actions.

Output:
```
(NO-PLAN)
```
