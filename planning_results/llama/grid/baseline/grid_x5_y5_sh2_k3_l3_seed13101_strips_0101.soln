Based on the provided prompt, I will attempt to generate a plan for the given problem.

First, let's analyze the problem:

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos2-1, and the key2 to the position pos2-0.

The constraints are:

- The robot cannot move to the position pos1-3.

Now, let's generate a plan:

1. Move the key1 to the position pos2-1.
2. Move the key2 to the position pos2-0.

Since the robot cannot move to the position pos1-3, we cannot use the move action for the key1. Therefore, we will use the pickup action to move the key1 to the position pos2-1.

Here is the plan:

(pickup key1)
(move key1 pos2-1)
(pickup key2)
(move key2 pos2-0)

The final output is:

(pickup key1)
(move key1 pos2-1)
(pickup key2)
(move key2 pos2-0)
