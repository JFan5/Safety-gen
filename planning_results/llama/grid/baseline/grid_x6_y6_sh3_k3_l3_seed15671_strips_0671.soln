Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos1-3 key0)
(move pos1-3 pos2-3)
(unlock pos2-5 key2)
(move pos2-5 pos5-5)
(pick pos5-5 key1)
(move pos5-5 pos4-5)
(drop pos4-5 key2)
(move pos4-5 pos3-5)
(drop pos3-5 key1)
(move pos3-5 pos2-3)
(move pos2-3 pos1-3)
(move pos1-3 pos0-3)
(move pos0-3 pos0-2)
(move pos0-2 pos0-1)
(move pos0-1 pos0-0)
(move pos0-0 pos1-0)
(move pos1-0 pos1-1)
(move pos1-1 pos1-2)
(move pos1-2 pos1-3)
(move pos1-3 pos1-4)
(move pos1-4 pos1-5)
(move pos1-5 pos2-5)
(move pos2-5 pos3-5)
(move pos3-5 pos4-5)
(move pos4-5 pos5-5)

This plan satisfies the given constraints and goals, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
