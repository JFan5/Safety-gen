To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the planning rules:

* The problem is to move the key from position 1 to position 2.
* The planning rules state that we can only use available symbols, and we must respect the typing of each action argument.
* The problem includes a constraint that we cannot move the robot to position 2.

Based on these rules, we can generate a plan:

1. (unlock pos2-0 shape1)
2. (unlock pos1-0 shape1)
3. (move pos1-0 pos2-0)
4. (pick pos2-0)
5. (drop pos1-0)
6. (move pos1-0 pos2-0)
7. (drop pos2-0)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals, and it is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

Here is the final output:

(unlock pos2-0 shape1)
(unlock pos1-0 shape1)
(move pos1-0 pos2-0)
(pick pos2-0)
(drop pos1-0)
(move pos1-0 pos2-0)
(drop pos2-0)
