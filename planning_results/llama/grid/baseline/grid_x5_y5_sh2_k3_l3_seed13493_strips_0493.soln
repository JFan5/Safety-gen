To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and identify the goals and constraints:

* Goal: (and (at key0 pos4-0) (at key1 pos0-1))
* Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-0))

Since the goal is to move the key0 to pos4-0 and key1 to pos0-1, and the constraint is that the robot cannot be at pos1-0, we need to find a way to move the key1 to pos1-0 without violating the constraint.

One possible plan is:

(move key1 pos1-0)
(pick key1 pos1-0)
(drop key1 pos1-0)
(move key1 pos0-1)

However, this plan is not valid because it involves moving the key1 to pos1-0 and then dropping it, which is not allowed.

A valid plan is:

(move key1 pos1-0)
(pick key1 pos1-0)
(drop key1 pos1-0)
(move key1 pos0-1)
(drop key1 pos1-0)

But this plan is still not valid because it involves dropping the key1 twice.

A valid plan is:

(move key1 pos1-0)
(pick key1 pos1-0)
(drop key1 pos1-0)
(move key1 pos0-1)

This plan is valid because it does not involve dropping the key1 twice.

Therefore, the final output is:

(move key1 pos1-0)
(pick key1 pos1-0)
(drop key1 pos1-0)
(move key1 pos0-1)
