To produce the final output, we need to analyze the given domain and problem, and then generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

The domain is a grid with various objects, shapes, and keys. The problem is to move the key0 to the position pos4-0 and the key3 to the position pos1-3.

To satisfy the constraints, we need to ensure that the plan does not violate any invariants or safety constraints implied by the domain/problem. In this case, we need to avoid the position pos2-3.

Here is a possible plan:

(move key0 pos4-0)
(move key3 pos1-3)

This plan moves the key0 to the position pos4-0 and the key3 to the position pos1-3, while avoiding the position pos2-3.

The final output is:

(move key0 pos4-0)
(move key3 pos1-3)

This plan satisfies the goals and constraints of the problem, and it is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.
