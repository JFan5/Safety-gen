Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key to the position where it is at the robot's position.

The constraints are that the robot cannot be at position 2.

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos3-0)
(move key1 pos3-1)
(move key1 pos3-0)

This plan moves the key to the position where it is at the robot's position, satisfying the goal. It also respects the constraint that the robot cannot be at position 2.

Here is the final output:

(move key1 pos3-0)
(move key1 pos3-1)
(move key1 pos3-0)
