Based on the provided domain, problem, and planning rules, I will attempt to generate a plan.

After analyzing the problem, I noticed that the goal is to move the key to the correct location. However, the initial state does not satisfy the goal, and there are constraints that need to be satisfied.

Here is a possible plan:

1. (unlock pos1-5 shape1)
2. (move pos1-5 pos2-3)
3. (unlock pos2-3 shape2)
4. (move pos2-3 pos2-1)
5. (unlock pos2-1 shape3)
6. (move pos2-1 pos0-3)
7. (unlock pos0-3 shape0)
8. (move pos0-3 pos4-1)
9. (unlock pos4-1 shape1)
10. (move pos4-1 pos4-3)
11. (unlock pos4-3 shape2)
12. (move pos4-3 pos5-4)
13. (unlock pos5-4 shape3)
14. (move pos5-4 pos5-5)

Please note that this plan is not guaranteed to be optimal, as the problem is not fully specified. However, it should satisfy the goal and constraints.

Output:

(move pos1-5 pos2-3)
(move pos2-3 pos2-1)
(move pos2-1 pos0-3)
(move pos0-3 pos4-1)
(move pos4-1 pos4-3)
(move pos4-3 pos5-4)
(move pos5-4 pos5-5)
