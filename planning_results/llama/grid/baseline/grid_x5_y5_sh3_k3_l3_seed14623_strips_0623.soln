To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, we need to validate the initial state and ensure that all action preconditions hold. Then, we can start planning by selecting actions that satisfy the preconditions.

Here is the plan:
(move pos2-2 pos3-0)
(unlock pos2-3 key0)
(move pos2-3 pos4-1)
(move pos1-2 key1)
(move pos1-2 pos3-1)
(move pos1-2 pos4-1)
(move pos1-2 pos4-3)
(move pos1-2 pos4-4)
(move pos1-2 pos4-1)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and constraints provided in the problem.
