To solve the problem, we need to find a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to pos1-2, and the constraint is that the robot cannot be at pos3-4.

Here is a possible plan:

(move pos4-1)
(pick pos4-1)
(move pos1-2)
(drop pos4-1)
(move pos4-1)
(pick pos4-1)
(move pos1-2)
(drop pos4-1)

However, this plan is not optimal. We can simplify it by removing the unnecessary steps.

Here is the simplified plan:

(move pos4-1)
(pick pos4-1)
(move pos1-2)
(drop pos4-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints.

The final output is:

(move pos4-1)
(pick pos4-1)
(move pos1-2)
(drop pos4-1)
