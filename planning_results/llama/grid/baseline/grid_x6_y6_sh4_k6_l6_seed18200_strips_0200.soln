Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos3-3 shape0)
(move pos3-3 pos4-0)
(unlock pos4-5 shape1)
(move pos4-5 pos1-2)
(pick pos1-2 key1)
(move pos1-2 pos5-3)
(pick pos5-3 key0)
(move pos5-3 pos2-4)
(pick pos2-4 key2)
(move pos2-4 pos0-5)
(pick pos0-5 key3)
(move pos0-5 pos3-0)
(pick pos3-0 key4)
(move pos3-0 pos1-0)
(pick pos1-0 key5)

This plan satisfies all the goals and constraints specified in the problem.
