Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to the position pos0-3, and the key2 to the position pos0-3.

Here is the plan:

(move key0 pos0-3)
(move key2 pos0-3)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.

The final output is:

(move key0 pos0-3)
(move key2 pos0-3)
