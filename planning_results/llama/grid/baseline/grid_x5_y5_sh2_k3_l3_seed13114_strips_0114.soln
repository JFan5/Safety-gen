Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos4-2, and the key1 to pos2-4.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos4-2 key0 shape0)
(move pos4-2 pos4-2)
(at key0 pos4-2)
(unlock pos2-4 key1 shape1)
(move pos2-4 pos2-4)
(at key1 pos2-4)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
