Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key2 to the position pos3-0.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(at key2 pos3-0)

This plan consists of only one step, which is to move the key2 to the position pos3-0.

The final output is:

(at key2 pos3-0)
