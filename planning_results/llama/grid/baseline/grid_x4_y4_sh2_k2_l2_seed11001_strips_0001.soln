Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos1-3 key0 shape0)
(move pos1-3 pos2-2)
(unlock pos2-2 key1 shape1)
(move pos2-2 pos3-3)
(pick pos3-3 key1)
(drop pos3-3 key1)
(move pos3-3 pos1-3)
(pick pos1-3 key0)
(drop pos1-3 key0)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the key0 to pos1-3 and key1 to pos3-3, while also satisfying the constraints and invariants implied by the domain and problem.
