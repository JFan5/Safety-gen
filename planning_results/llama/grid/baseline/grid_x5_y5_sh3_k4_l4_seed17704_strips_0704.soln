Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so the output will be:

```
NO-PLAN
```

This is because the initial state is already in a goal-directed state, and there are no additional actions that can be taken to satisfy the goals.
