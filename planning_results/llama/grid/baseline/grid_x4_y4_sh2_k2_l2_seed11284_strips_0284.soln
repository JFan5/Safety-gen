To generate the plan, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided in the problem statement. We will use the PDDL2 planning system to generate the plan.

First, we need to define the plan and the initial state. We will use the `pddl2` library to define the plan and the initial state.

```python
import pddl2

# Define the problem
problem = pddl2.Problem(
    domain=pddl2.Domain(
        constants=pddl2.Constants(
            objects=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        ),
        predicates=['conn', 'lock-shape', 'key-shape', 'at', 'holding', 'open']
    ),
    objects=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
    constants=pddl2.Constants(
        objects=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    ),
    init=pddl2.Init(
        objects=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
        actions=['move', 'pickup', 'putdown', 'unlock'],
        constraints=[pddl2.Constraint('always', 'not (at-robot pos1-2)')]
    ),
    goal=pddl2.Goal(
        objects=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
        actions=['move', 'pickup', 'putdown', 'unlock'],
        constraints=[pddl2.Constraint('always', 'not (at-robot pos1-2)')]
    )
)

# Define the plan
plan = pddl2.Plan(
    actions=['move', 'pickup', 'putdown', 'unlock'],
    constraints=[pddl2.Constraint('always', 'not (at-robot pos1-2)')]
)

# Generate the plan
generated_plan = pddl2.generate_plan(problem, plan)

# Print the generated plan
for step in generated_plan:
    print(step)
```

This code will generate the plan and print it to the console. The plan will be a sequence of actions that satisfy the goal and constraints of the problem.

Please note that the generated plan may not be optimal, as the PDDL2 planning system uses a heuristic search algorithm to generate the plan. The quality of the plan depends on the complexity of the problem and the quality of the heuristic function.

Also, please note that the `pddl2` library is not a real library, it's just a placeholder for the actual library you would use to solve the problem. You would need to replace it with the actual library you are using.

Once you have generated the plan, you can use it to solve the problem. The plan will be a sequence of actions that can be executed to achieve the goal.
