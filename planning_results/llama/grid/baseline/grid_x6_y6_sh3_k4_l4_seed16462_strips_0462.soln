Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to the position pos4-5 and the key2 to the position pos4-1.

Here is the plan:

(move key0 pos4-5)
(pick key2 pos4-1)
(move key2 pos4-1)
(move key0 pos4-5)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a sequential, grounded plan.

Here is the output:

(move key0 pos4-5)
(pick key2 pos4-1)
(move key2 pos4-1)
(move key0 pos4-5)
