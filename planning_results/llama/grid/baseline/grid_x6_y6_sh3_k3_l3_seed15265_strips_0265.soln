Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to pos5-4 and the key2 to pos1-1.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos5-4)
(move key2 pos1-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a totally-ordered, grounded plan.
