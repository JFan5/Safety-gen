Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a plan for the given problem.

The problem is to unlock a shape, move to a position, and pick up an object. The initial state satisfies all goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(open pos0-3)
(lock-shape pos0-3 shape0)
(move pos0-3 pos1-3)
(at key1 pos1-3)
(pick key1 pos1-3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions involved. It unlocks the shape, moves to the position, and picks up the key.
