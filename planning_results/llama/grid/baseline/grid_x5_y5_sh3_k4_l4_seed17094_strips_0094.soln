To produce the final output, we need to analyze the given problem and plan the actions to satisfy the goal and constraints.

The problem is:
```
(define (problem grid-5-5-3-4-4)
    (:domain grid)
    (:objects
    pos0-0 pos0-1 pos0-2 pos0-3 pos0-4 pos1-0 pos1-1 pos1-2 pos1-3 pos1-4 pos2-0 pos2-1 pos2-2 pos2-3 pos2-4 pos3-0 pos3-1 pos3-2 pos3-3 pos3-4 pos4-0 pos4-1 pos4-2 pos4-3 pos4-4
    shape0 shape1 shape2
    key0 key1 key2 key3
    )

    (:init
       (arm-empty)

       (place pos0-0)
       (place pos0-1)
       (place pos0-2)
       (place pos0-3)
       (place pos0-4)
       (place pos1-0)
       (place pos1-1)
       (place pos1-2)
       (place pos1-3)
       (place pos1-4)
       (place pos2-0)
       (place pos2-1)
       (place pos2-2)
       (place pos2-3)
       (place pos2-4)
       (place pos3-0)
       (place pos3-1)
       (place pos3-2)
       (place pos3-3)
       (place pos3-4)
       (place pos4-0)
       (place pos4-1)
       (place pos4-2)
       (place pos4-3)
       (place pos4-4)
       (lock-shape  pos1-3 shape0)
       (lock-shape  pos2-1 shape1)
       (lock-shape  pos4-2 shape2)
       (lock-shape  pos0-2 shape0)
       (open pos0-0)
       (open pos0-1)
       (open pos0-3)
       (open pos0-4)
       (open pos1-0)
       (open pos1-1)
       (open pos1-2)
       (open pos1-4)
       (open pos2-0)
       (open pos2-2)
       (open pos2-3)
       (open pos2-4)
       (open pos3-0)
       (open pos3-1)
       (open pos3-2)
       (open pos3-3)
       (open pos3-4)
       (open pos4-0)
       (open pos4-1)
       (open pos4-3)
       (open pos4-4)

       (key-shape  key0 shape0)
       (key-shape  key1 shape1)
       (key-shape  key2 shape2)
       (key-shape  key3 shape2)
       (at key1 pos4-3)
       (at key3 pos3-0)
    )

    (:goal (and
       (at key1 pos4-3)
       (at key3 pos3-0)
    ))
    (:constraints
      (always (not (at-robot pos2-0)))
    )
)
```
The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos4-3 and the key3 to the position pos3-0.

The plan is:
(move key1 pos4-3)
(pick key3 pos3-0)
(drop key3 pos3-0)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints.
