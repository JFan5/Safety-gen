Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key2 to pos2-4 and key3 to pos3-2.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos2-1 shape1)
(move pos2-1 pos2-4)
(unlock pos3-3 shape2)
(move pos3-3 pos3-2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
