Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key0 to pos0-2 and key1 to pos4-3.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos0-2 key0 shape0)
(move pos0-2 pos0-2)
(pick key0 pos0-2)
(move pos0-2 pos4-3)
(pick key1 pos4-3)
(drop key1 pos4-3)
(drop key0 pos0-2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
