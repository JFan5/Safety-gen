Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move the key to the positions where it should be, which are pos3-2, pos3-0, and pos2-4.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos3-3 key0 shape0)
(move pos3-3 pos3-2 key0)
(unlock pos2-1 key2 shape2)
(move pos2-1 pos2-4 key2)
(unlock pos3-0 key1 shape1)
(move pos3-0 pos3-3 key1)
(unlock pos4-4 key3 shape1)
(move pos4-4 pos3-0 key3)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints.
