Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan to satisfy the goal.

Since the goal is to move the key0 to pos2-1, I will first unlock the key0, then move it to pos2-1.

Here is the plan:

(unlock key0 pos1-2 shape0)
(move key0 pos2-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints.
