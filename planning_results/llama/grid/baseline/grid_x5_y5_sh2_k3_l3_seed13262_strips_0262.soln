Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan to satisfy the goal of moving the key2 to pos0-0.

Here is the plan:

(unlock pos3-4 key2)
(move key2 pos0-0)
(at key2 pos0-0)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the key2 to pos0-0 and also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
