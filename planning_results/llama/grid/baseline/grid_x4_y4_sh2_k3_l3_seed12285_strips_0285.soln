Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key2 to the position 2-1.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(at key2 pos2-1)
(unlock pos2-1 key2 shape0)
(move key2 pos2-1)
(at-robot pos2-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and only uses available symbols.
