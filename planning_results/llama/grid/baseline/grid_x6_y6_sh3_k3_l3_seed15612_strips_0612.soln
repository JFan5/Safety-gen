Based on the provided domain, problem, and planning rules, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos1-2.

The constraints are:

* The robot can only move to the positions pos1-4, pos1-5, pos2-0, pos2-1, pos2-2, pos2-3, pos2-4, pos2-5, and pos3-0, pos3-1, pos3-2, pos3-3, pos3-4, pos3-5.
* The key1 cannot be moved to the position pos1-3.

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos1-2)
(pick key1 pos1-2)
(drop key1 pos1-2)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a sequential, grounded plan.

The final output is:

(move key1 pos1-2)
(pick key1 pos1-2)
(drop key1 pos1-2)
