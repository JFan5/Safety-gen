Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to move the key1 to the position pos0-1.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(move key1 pos0-1)
(pick key1 pos0-1)
(drop key1 pos0-1)

However, the plan can be simplified by removing the unnecessary pick and drop actions.

Here is the simplified plan:

(move key1 pos0-1)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints, and it is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.
