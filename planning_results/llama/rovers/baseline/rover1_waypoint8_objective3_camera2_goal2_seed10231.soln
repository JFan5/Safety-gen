Based on the provided input, I will generate a plan that satisfies the conditions.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so the output will be:

```
(No-Plan)
```

However, if we want to generate a plan that satisfies the constraints, we can try the following:

The PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints are:

(sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint3))

We can try to satisfy this constraint by moving the rover to waypoint 3 first, and then moving it to waypoint 1.

Here is the plan:

(move rover0 waypoint3)
(move rover0 waypoint1)

This plan satisfies the constraint, but it may not be the optimal solution. The output will be:

```
(move rover0 waypoint3)
(move rover0 waypoint1)
```
