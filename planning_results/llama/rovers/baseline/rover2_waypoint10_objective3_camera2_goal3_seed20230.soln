Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

Here is the plan:

(drop waypoint7 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8 waypoint9)
(drop rover0 rover1)
(drop rover1 rover0)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint0)

(drop waypoint8 waypoint1)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7 waypoint2)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6 waypoint3)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5 waypoint4)
(drop rover0 rover1)
(drop rover1 rover0)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint8)
