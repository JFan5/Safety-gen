Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(drop rover1store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint9)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint11)
(navigate rover0 waypoint11 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint8)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint11)
(navigate rover0 waypoint11 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint8)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint8)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint10)
(navigate rover0 waypoint10 waypoint8)
(at_lander general waypoint11)
(communicated_image_data objective3 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
