Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

The problem is to communicate soil and rock data, as well as image data, from three different waypoints to a lander. The domain includes a rover, a lander, a store, and various waypoints, cameras, and objects.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(drop waypoint1store)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(drop waypoint2store)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5store)
(at_rock_sample waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6store)
(at_soil_sample waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9store)
(at_lander general waypoint7)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint6)
(communicated_image_data objective2 low_res)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and constraints of the problem, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
