Based on the provided problem and domain, I will generate a plan that satisfies the conditions.

The initial state satisfies the constraints, and the goal is to communicate soil data and rock data. Here is a plan that achieves the goal:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(drop general)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 objective0 high_res)
(communicate_soil_data waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 objective1 high_res)

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints. Note that the plan involves dropping the lander and navigating to the objective waypoints to take images and communicate data.
