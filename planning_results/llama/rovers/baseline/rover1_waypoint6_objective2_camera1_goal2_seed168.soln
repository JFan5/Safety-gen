Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to communicate rock data from waypoint 3 to the lander, communicate image data from the objective to the colour, and communicate image data from the objective to the high-res mode.

The constraints are that the rock data must be communicated before the image data, and the rock data must be communicated before the image data from the high-res mode.

Here is the plan:
