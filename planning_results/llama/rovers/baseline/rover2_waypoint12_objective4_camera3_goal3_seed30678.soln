Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input.

Since the goal is to communicate soil data, we need to perform the following actions:

1. Sample soil at waypoint 6.
2. Sample soil at waypoint 8.
3. Sample soil at waypoint 5.
4. Communicate soil data at waypoint 6.
5. Communicate soil data at waypoint 8.
6. Communicate soil data at waypoint 5.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_soil_sample waypoint8)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint6)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint8)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint5)

Note that the plan only includes the actions that are necessary to achieve the goal, and it is totally-ordered and grounded, meaning that it does not include any variables, timestamps, or durations.
