Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The plan is as follows:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(drop rover1store rover1)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint1 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint10)
(drop rover0 rover0)
(drop rover1 rover1)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint1)
(drop waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint3)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint4)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint10)
(drop rover0 rover0)
(drop rover1 rover1)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint1)
(drop waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint3)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint4)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint10)
(drop rover0 rover0)
(drop rover1 rover1)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint1)
(drop waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint3)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint4)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint10)
(drop rover0 rover0)
(drop rover1 rover1)
(drop general general)
(drop waypoint0 waypoint1)
(drop waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop waypoint2 waypoint3)
(drop waypoint3 waypoint4)
(drop waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop waypoint6 waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7 waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8 waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9 waypoint10)
(drop rover0 rover0)
(drop rover1 rover1)
(drop general general)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
