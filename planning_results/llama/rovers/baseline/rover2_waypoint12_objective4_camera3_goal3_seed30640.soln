Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (at_lander general waypoint3)
2. (at rover0 waypoint4)
3. (at rover1 waypoint6)
4. (communicated_rock_data waypoint6)
5. (communicated_rock_data waypoint11)
6. (communicated_rock_data waypoint8)
7. (communicated_rock_data waypoint9)
8. (at rover0 waypoint10)
9. (at rover1 waypoint10)
10. (communicated_image_data objective1 low_res)
11. (communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)

Therefore, the final output is:

(at_lander general waypoint3)
(at rover0 waypoint4)
(at rover1 waypoint6)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint6)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint11)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint8)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint9)
(at rover0 waypoint10)
(at rover1 waypoint10)
(communicated_image_data objective1 low_res)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)
