Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

After analyzing the domain and problem, I found that the goal of communicating image data from objective 3, low_res, and objective 0, colour, and objective 1, high_res is not achievable given the constraints. The constraints imply that at some point before communicating image data from objective 3, low_res, and objective 0, colour, and objective 1, high_res, the rover must be at waypoint 4, but it is currently at waypoint 6.

Therefore, I will output:

(NO-PLAN)
