Based on the provided problem and planning rules, I will generate a plan for the Rover problem.

Since there are no constraints in the problem, I will proceed with goal-directed planning.

The goal is to communicate soil data. The plan is as follows:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint0)

This plan involves traversing from the initial state to the rock sample, then to the soil sample, and finally communicating the soil data.

Please note that this plan is grounded and totally ordered, and it satisfies the preconditions for each action.

Here is the final output:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint0)
