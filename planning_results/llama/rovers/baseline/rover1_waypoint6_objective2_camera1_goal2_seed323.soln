Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(drop general)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint5)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint4)

Note: This plan satisfies the goal of communicating soil data, image data, and the constraints of the problem.
