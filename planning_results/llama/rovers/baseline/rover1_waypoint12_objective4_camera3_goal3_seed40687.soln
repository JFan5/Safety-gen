Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so I will output nothing.

However, since the problem requires a plan, I will provide a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_rock_sample waypoint8)
(at_soil_sample waypoint9)
(at_rock_sample waypoint9)
(at_soil_sample waypoint10)
(at_rock_sample waypoint10)
(at_soil_sample waypoint11)
(at_lander general waypoint3)
(channel_free general)
(at rover0 waypoint10)
(available rover0)
(store_of rover0store rover0)
(empty rover0store)
(equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0)
(equipped_for_imaging rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(on_board camera0 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective3)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(on_board camera1 rover0)
(calibration_target camera1 objective3)
(supports camera1 colour)
(supports camera1 high_res)
(supports camera1 low_res)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint8)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint9)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint10)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint11)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint7)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint8)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint10)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint11)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint8)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint10)

The plan consists of 20 steps, which are:

1. (at_rock_sample waypoint0)
2. (at_soil_sample waypoint3)
3. (at_rock_sample waypoint3)
4. (at_soil_sample waypoint4)
5. (at_soil_sample waypoint5)
6. (at_soil_sample waypoint6)
7. (at_rock_sample waypoint8)
8. (at_soil_sample waypoint9)
9. (at_rock_sample waypoint9)
10. (at_soil_sample waypoint10)
11. (at_rock_sample waypoint10)
12. (at_soil_sample waypoint11)
13. (at_lander general waypoint3)
14. (channel_free general)
15. (at rover0 waypoint10)
16. (available rover0)
17. (store_of rover0store rover0)
18. (empty rover0store)
19. (equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0)
20. (equipped_for_imaging rover0)
