Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions. Please note that the plan is grounded and totally ordered.

1. (move rover0 waypoint11)
2. (pick waypoint11 waypoint10)
3. (pick waypoint10 waypoint9)
4. (pick waypoint9 waypoint8)
5. (pick waypoint8 waypoint7)
6. (pick waypoint7 waypoint6)
7. (pick waypoint6 waypoint5)
8. (pick waypoint5 waypoint4)
9. (pick waypoint4 waypoint3)
10. (pick waypoint3 waypoint2)
11. (pick waypoint2 waypoint1)
12. (pick waypoint1 waypoint0)
13. (move rover0 waypoint0)
14. (move rover0 waypoint1)
15. (move rover0 waypoint2)
16. (move rover0 waypoint3)
17. (move rover0 waypoint4)
18. (move rover0 waypoint5)
19. (move rover0 waypoint6)
20. (move rover0 waypoint7)
21. (move rover0 waypoint8)
22. (move rover0 waypoint9)
23. (move rover0 waypoint10)
24. (move rover0 waypoint11)
25. (at_soil_sample waypoint11)
26. (at_rock_sample waypoint11)
27. (at_lander general waypoint11)
28. (communicated_rock_data waypoint11)
29. (communicated_rock_data waypoint8)
30. (communicated_rock_data waypoint4)
31. (communicated_image_data objective3 high_res)
32. (communicated_image_data objective2 low_res)
33. (communicated_image_data objective1 colour)

This plan satisfies the goal of collecting rock samples and communicating the image data. It also ensures that all constraints are satisfied.
