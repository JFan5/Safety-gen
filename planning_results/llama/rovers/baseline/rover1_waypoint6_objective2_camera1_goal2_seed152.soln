Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

After analyzing the domain and problem, I have identified the following plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(pick rover0store rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)
(available rover0)

This plan satisfies the given constraints and goals, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.

Here is the final output:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(pick rover0store rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)
(available rover0)
