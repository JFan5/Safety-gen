Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to communicate image data for objectives 1 and 0, and the constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_lander general waypoint10)
(on_board camera1 rover0)
(calibration_target camera1 objective1)
(supports camera1 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective1 high_res)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint10)
(on_board camera2 rover0)
(calibration_target camera2 objective3)
(supports camera2 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective0 high_res)

Note that the plan involves multiple actions and objects, and it is a grounded plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.
