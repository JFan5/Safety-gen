Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(drop waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(drop waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(drop waypoint5)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(drop waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint8)
(at_soil_sample waypoint8)
(drop waypoint8)
(at_rock_sample waypoint9)
(at_soil_sample waypoint9)
(drop waypoint9)
(at_rock_sample waypoint11)
(at_soil_sample waypoint11)
(drop waypoint11)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint7)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint5)
(communicated_image_data objective0 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)
(communicated_image_data objective3 low_res)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
