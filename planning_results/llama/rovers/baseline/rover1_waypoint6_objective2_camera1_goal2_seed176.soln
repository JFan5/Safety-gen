Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

After analyzing the domain and problem, I have identified the following plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_lander general waypoint5)
(communicated_image_data objective0 colour)
(at_rover0 waypoint3)
(available rover0)
(store_of rover0store rover0)
(empty rover0store)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint2)
(on_board camera0 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective1)
(supports camera0 colour)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(supports camera0 low_res)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint2)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint0)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint2)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint4)

This plan satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem, including the constraints and the goal of communicating the image data.
