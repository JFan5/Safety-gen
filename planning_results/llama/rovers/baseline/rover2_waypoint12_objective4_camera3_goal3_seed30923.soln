Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to communicate soil data, rock data, and image data.

The constraints are:

* Always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover1 waypoint0)))
* Always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint7) (at rover1 waypoint7)))
* Always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover1 waypoint1)))

Since the goal is to communicate soil data, rock data, and image data, we need to ensure that the rover has the necessary data.

Here is a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints:

1. (take_image rover0 waypoint7 high_res)
2. (take_image rover0 waypoint9 high_res)
3. (take_image rover0 waypoint1 high_res)
4. (take_image rover0 waypoint0 high_res)
5. (communicate_soil_data waypoint7)
6. (communicate_rock_data waypoint9)
7. (communicate_image_data objective2 colour)

This plan ensures that the rover has the necessary data and communicates the soil, rock, and image data.

The final output is:

1. (take_image rover0 waypoint7 high_res)
2. (take_image rover0 waypoint9 high_res)
3. (take_image rover0 waypoint1 high_res)
4. (take_image rover0 waypoint0 high_res)
5. (communicate_soil_data waypoint7)
6. (communicate_rock_data waypoint9)
7. (communicate_image_data objective2 colour)
