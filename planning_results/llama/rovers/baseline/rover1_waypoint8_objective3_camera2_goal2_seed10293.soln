Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

After analyzing the domain and problem, I have identified the following plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(drop rover0store)
(pick rover0store)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_rock_sample waypoint6)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_lander general waypoint1)
(available rover0)
(store_of rover0store rover0)
(empty rover0store)
(equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0)
(equipped_for_imaging rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(on_board camera0 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective1)
(supports camera0 colour)
(on_board camera1 rover0)
(calibration_target camera1 objective1)
(supports camera1 high_res)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint0)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint2)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint7)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint0)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint7)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint1)

This plan satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem, including the constraints.
