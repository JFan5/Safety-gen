Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Since the goal is to communicate image data, and the objective is to communicate image data with the low-res camera, I will start by using the camera to take an image.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint5)
(on_board camera0 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective1)
(supports camera0 low_res)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 camera0 low_res)
(communicated_image_data objective1 low_res)

This plan satisfies the goal of communicating image data with the low-res camera, and it only uses available symbols and respects the typing and constraints of the domain and problem.
