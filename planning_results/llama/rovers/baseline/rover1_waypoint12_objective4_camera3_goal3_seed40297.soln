Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

The problem is to communicate soil data from waypoint 9 to the lander, and communicate rock data from waypoint 1 to the lander.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint9)
(at_lander general waypoint11)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint9)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint1)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint11)

This plan satisfies the goal of communicating soil data from waypoint 9 to the lander, and communicating rock data from both waypoints 1 and 11 to the lander.
