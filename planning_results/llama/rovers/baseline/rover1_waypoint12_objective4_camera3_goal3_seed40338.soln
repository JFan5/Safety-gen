(communicated_rock_data waypoint3)
(communicated_image_data objective1 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective2 high_res)
(sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint10) (at rover0 waypoint0))

Note that this plan is not the final answer, as the problem is still unsatisfiable given the domain and problem. The output is just the plan that was generated by the planning engine.
