Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input.

Since the problem doesn't provide a clear plan, I will generate a plan based on the given domain and problem. The goal is to communicate soil and rock data, and to take an image.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(drop rover0 waypoint9)
(available rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint9)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(empty rover0store)
(equipped_for_rock_analysis rover0)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint9)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(drop rover1 waypoint3)
(available rover1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint9 waypoint3)
(drop rover1store rover1)
(empty rover1store)
(equipped_for_imaging rover1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint6)
(communicated_image_data objective1 low_res)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint4)

Note that this plan is not the only possible solution, and there may be other valid plans.
