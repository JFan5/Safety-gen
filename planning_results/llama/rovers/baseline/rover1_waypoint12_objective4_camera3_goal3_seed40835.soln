Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a plan for the Rover domain-agnostic planning engine.

The goal is to communicate soil data, image data, and to satisfy the constraints.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint11)
(at_lander general waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint10)
(at_soil_sample waypoint11)
(at_lander general)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint11)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint0)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint4)
(communicated_image_data objective3 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective1 low_res)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints.
