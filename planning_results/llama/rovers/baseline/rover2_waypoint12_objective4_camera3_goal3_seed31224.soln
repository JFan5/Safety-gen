Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

The plan is as follows:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(drop rover0store)
(drop rover1store)
(drop general)
(drop waypoint0)
(drop waypoint1)
(drop waypoint2)
(drop waypoint3)
(drop waypoint4)
(drop waypoint5)
(drop waypoint6)
(drop waypoint7)
(drop waypoint8)
(drop waypoint9)
(drop waypoint10)
(drop waypoint11)
(at_lander general waypoint11)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint11)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint3)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint4)
(communicated_image_data objective0 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective3 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective2 high_res)

Please note that this plan is based on the provided domain and problem, and it may not be the optimal solution. The goal of the planning engine is to produce a valid plan, not necessarily the optimal one.
