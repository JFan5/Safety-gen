Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_soil_sample waypoint8)
(at_soil_sample waypoint9)
(at_rock_sample waypoint9)
(at_rock_sample waypoint10)
(at_lander general waypoint10)
(available rover0)
(store_of rover0store rover0)
(empty rover0store)
(equipped_for_imaging rover0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint2)
(on_board camera0 rover1)
(calibration_target camera0 objective3)
(supports camera0 colour)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint5)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint7)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint9)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint0)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint10)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective2 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective3 colour)

Note that the plan is in the format specified in the prompt, with each action and object name exactly as written in the domain/problem.
