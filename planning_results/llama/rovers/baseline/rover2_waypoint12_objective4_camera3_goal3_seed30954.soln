Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

The plan is as follows:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint11)
(on_board camera0 rover1)
(calibration_target camera0 objective3)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(on_board camera1 rover1)
(calibration_target camera1 objective0)
(supports camera1 high_res)
(supports camera1 low_res)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint2)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint7)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint10)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint11)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint9)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint11)
