Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

The problem is to communicate soil and rock data, and image data from an objective to a waypoint. The constraints are that the rock data must be communicated before the soil data, and the image data must be communicated after the rock data.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint0)
(communicated_image_data objective0 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective3 low_res)

Note that this plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
