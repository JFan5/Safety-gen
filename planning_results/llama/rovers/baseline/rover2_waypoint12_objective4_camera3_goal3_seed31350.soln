Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The plan is as follows:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(at rover0 waypoint9)
(at rover1 waypoint4)
(available rover1)
(available rover0)
(store_of rover0store rover0)
(empty rover1store)
(equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0)
(equipped_for_rock_analysis rover1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint10)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint10 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint11)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint11 waypoint8)
(on_board camera0 rover1)
(on_board camera1 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective2)
(calibration_target camera1 objective1)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(supports camera1 low_res)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint3)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint8)
(visible_from objective0 waypoint11)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective1 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint0)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint1)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint5)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint6)
(visible_from objective2 waypoint11)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint4)
(visible_from objective3 waypoint9)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals provided in the problem.
