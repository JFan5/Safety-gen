Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

After analyzing the domain and problem, I have identified the following plan:

1. (take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 high_res)
2. (take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 high_res)
3. (take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective2 high_res)
4. (communicate_image_data objective0 high_res colour)
5. (communicate_image_data objective1 high_res colour)
6. (communicate_image_data objective2 high_res colour)
7. (communicate_soil_data waypoint2)
8. (communicate_rock_data waypoint0)
9. (communicate_rock_data waypoint2)
10. (communicate_rock_data waypoint0)

This plan satisfies the given conditions, including the goal of communicating image data and soil/rock data. It also ensures that all constraints are satisfied.

Here is the final output:

1. (take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 high_res)
2. (take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 high_res)
3. (take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective2 high_res)
4. (communicate_image_data objective0 high_res colour)
5. (communicate_image_data objective1 high_res colour)
6. (communicate_image_data objective2 high_res colour)
7. (communicate_soil_data waypoint2)
8. (communicate_rock_data waypoint0)
9. (communicate_rock_data waypoint2)
10. (communicate_rock_data waypoint0)
