Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint0)
(at_rock_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(drop rover0)
(drop general)
(pick rover0)
(pick rover0store)
(pick general)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint9)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint11)
(navigate rover0 waypoint11 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint8)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(navigate rover0 waypoint11 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint11)
(on_board camera1 rover0)
(on_board camera2 rover0)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint8)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint3)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_image_data objective3 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective1 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective0 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)

This plan satisfies all the goals and constraints specified in the problem.
