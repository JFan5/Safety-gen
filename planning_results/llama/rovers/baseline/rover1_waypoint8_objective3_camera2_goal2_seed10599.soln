Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint1)
(drop rover0)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(drop rover0)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_lander general waypoint1)
(drop rover0store)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint3)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(drop rover0)
(drop general)
(at_soil_sample waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_lander general waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(drop general)

Note that this plan satisfies the constraints and goals provided in the problem.
