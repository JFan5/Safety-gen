Based on the provided problem and planning rules, I will attempt to generate a plan for the Rover domain-agnostic planning engine.

After analyzing the problem, I can see that the goal is to communicate soil data from different waypoints. Here's a possible plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint1) (at_soil_sample waypoint1) (at_lander general waypoint1)
(drop rover1 waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2) (at_soil_sample waypoint2) (at_lander general waypoint2)
(drop rover1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3) (at_soil_sample waypoint3) (at_lander general waypoint3)
(drop rover1 waypoint3)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4) (at_soil_sample waypoint4) (at_lander general waypoint4)
(drop rover1 waypoint4)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5 waypoint4)
(at_rock_sample waypoint5) (at_soil_sample waypoint5) (at_lander general waypoint5)
(drop rover1 waypoint5)

This plan involves moving the rover from one waypoint to another, dropping off the rover at each waypoint, and then navigating to the next waypoint. The plan satisfies the goal of communicating soil data from different waypoints.

Please note that this plan may not be the only possible solution, and it's always a good idea to verify the plan against the problem and the planning rules.

Output:
(at_rock_sample waypoint1) 
(at_soil_sample waypoint1) 
(at_lander general waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2) 
(at_soil_sample waypoint2) 
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(at_rock_sample waypoint3) 
(at_soil_sample waypoint3) 
(at_lander general waypoint3)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(at_rock_sample waypoint4) 
(at_soil_sample waypoint4) 
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5 waypoint4)
