Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

The goal is to communicate the image data for objective2 with mode high_res.

The constraints are satisfied by the initial state, which already has the camera calibrated and the image data available.

Here is the plan:

(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint2)
(on_board camera0 rover0)
(calibration_target camera0 objective2)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective2 high_res)

Note that this plan only includes the necessary steps to achieve the goal, and does not include any unnecessary actions or states.
