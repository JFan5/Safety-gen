Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain a valid plan or a problem to be solved. The domain and problem are provided, but there is no specific task or goal to be achieved.

However, based on the constraints and the initial state, we can infer that the task is to collect soil samples from three different locations (waypoint 0, 8, and 11). The initial state already satisfies the constraints, and the goal is to collect soil samples.

Here is a possible plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint0)
(pick waypoint0)
(at_soil_sample waypoint8)
(pick waypoint8)
(at_soil_sample waypoint11)
(pick waypoint11)

Note that this plan assumes that the rover is already equipped with the necessary instruments (camera, etc.) and that the soil samples can be collected using the pick action. The actual plan may vary depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
