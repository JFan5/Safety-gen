Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given conditions.

Since the goal is to communicate the image data, we need to ensure that the camera is calibrated and the image is taken. We also need to make sure that the lander is channel-free.

Here is a possible plan:

(at_lander general waypoint4)
(channel_free general)
(calibrate camera0 objective0)
(take_image camera0 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective0 colour)

This plan satisfies the goal of communicating the image data, and it also ensures that the camera is calibrated and the lander is channel-free.

Please note that this is just one possible plan, and there may be other valid plans that also satisfy the conditions.

The final output is:

(at_lander general waypoint4)
(channel_free general)
(calibrate camera0 objective0)
(take_image camera0 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective0 colour)
