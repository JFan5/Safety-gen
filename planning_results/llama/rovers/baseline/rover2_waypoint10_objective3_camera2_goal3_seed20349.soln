Based on the provided prompt, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_rock_sample waypoint2)
(at_lander general waypoint4)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(drop rover1store rover1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint9 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint7 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint8 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(at rover1 waypoint1)
(available rover1)
(store_of rover1store rover1)
(empty rover1store)
(equipped_for_soil_analysis rover1)
(equipped_for_rock_analysis rover1)
(equipped_for_imaging rover1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint1 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint6 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint1 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint7 waypoint1)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint3 waypoint8)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint8 waypoint3)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint2 waypoint6)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint7 waypoint5)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint5 waypoint7)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint0 waypoint9)
(can_traverse rover1 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(on_board camera0 rover1)
(calibration_target camera0 objective2)
(supports camera0 high_res)
(on_board camera1 rover1)
(calibration_target camera1 objective2)
(supports camera1 colour)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint5)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint9)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint7)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint6)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint3)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint8)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint2)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective2 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective2 high_res)
(communicated_image_data objective2 low_res)

Note that this plan is a sequence of actions that satisfy the initial state and the goal, and it also satisfies all the constraints in the problem.
