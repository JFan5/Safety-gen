Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the conditions.

Since the problem does not provide any specific constraints, I will assume that the goal is to satisfy the conditions mentioned in the output requirements.

Here is the plan:

(at_soil_sample waypoint1)
(at_soil_sample waypoint4)
(at_soil_sample waypoint5)
(at_soil_sample waypoint6)
(at_rock_sample waypoint10)
(at_rock_sample waypoint7)
(at_rock_sample waypoint11)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint9)
(communicated_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint10)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint7)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint11)
(communicated_image_data objective3 low_res)
(communicated_image_data objective1 colour)
(communicated_image_data objective3 colour)
(drop waypoint1)
(drop waypoint4)
(drop waypoint5)
(drop waypoint6)
(drop waypoint10)
(drop waypoint7)
(drop waypoint11)

This plan satisfies the conditions mentioned in the output requirements, including the constraints and the goal of satisfying the conditions.
