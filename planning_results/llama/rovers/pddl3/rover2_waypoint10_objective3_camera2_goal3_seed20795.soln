<DOMAIN>
...</DOMAIN>

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a)
