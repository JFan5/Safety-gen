Producing the plan for the given problem:

1. (sample_soil rover0 waypoint3)
2. (sample_rock rover0 waypoint4)
3. (drop rover0 waypoint4)
4. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
5. (navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
6. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
7. (navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
8. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
9. (navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
10. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
11. (navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint4)
12. (navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
13. (calibrate camera0 rover0)
14. (take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective1 high_res)
15. (communicate_image_data objective1 high_res waypoint0)

Final plan:
1. (sample_soil rover0 waypoint3)
2. (sample_rock rover0 waypoint4)
3. (drop rover0 waypoint4)
4. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
5. (navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
6. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
7. (navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
8. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
9. (navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
10. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
11. (navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint4)
12. (navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
13. (calibrate camera0 rover0)
14. (take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective1 high_res)
15. (communicate_image_data objective1 high_res waypoint0)

The final answer is:
