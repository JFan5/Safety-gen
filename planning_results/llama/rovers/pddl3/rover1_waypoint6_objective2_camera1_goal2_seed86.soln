Since the problem is not empty and there are no constraints, we can proceed with the planning.

Here is the plan:

(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(drop rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint0)
(calibrate camera0 rover0 waypoint0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective1 colour)
(communicate_image_data objective1 colour general)
(communicate_soil_data waypoint0 general rover0)

Note: The plan only includes the necessary steps to achieve the goal, without any unnecessary actions.
