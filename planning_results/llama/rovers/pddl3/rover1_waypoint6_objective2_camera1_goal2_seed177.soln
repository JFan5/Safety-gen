Since the problem doesn't specify any specific input, I will generate a random valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the domain and problem you provided.

Here is the plan:

(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0store waypoint0)
(calibrate camera0 rover0 waypoint0)
(take_image camera0 low_res objective0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
 communicat_soil_data waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data waypoint1)
(communicate_image_data objective0)

Note that this plan is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid plans for the given domain and problem.
