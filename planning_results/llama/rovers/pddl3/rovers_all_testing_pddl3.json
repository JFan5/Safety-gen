lander at waypoint7 and the rover at waypoint8. We can then use the communicate_soil_data action to send the data from the rover to the lander, which is available at general.\n\n## Step 2: Plan for equipping the rover for imaging\nSince we are going to take an image, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for imaging. We can use the calibrate action to calibrate the camera on the rover.\n\n## Step 3: Plan for calibrating the camera\nTo calibrate the camera, we need to use the calibration_target action to calibrate the camera with the objective3.\n\n## Step 4: Plan for taking the image\nWith the camera calibrated, we can now take the image using the take_image action.\n\n## Step 5: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general\nAfter taking the image, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.\n\n## Step 6: Plan for communicating rock data from waypoint6 to general\nTo communicate rock data from waypoint6 to general, we need to use the lander at waypoint6 and the rover at waypoint7. We can then use the communicate_rock_data action to send the data from the rover to the lander, which is available at general.\n\n## Step 7: Plan for equipping the rover for soil analysis\nSince we are going to analyze the soil, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for soil analysis. We can use the equipped_for_soil_analysis action to check if the rover is equipped for soil analysis.\n\n## Step 8: Plan for equipping the rover for communication\nSince we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication. We can use the equipped_for_imaging action to check if the rover is equipped for communication.\n\n## Step 9: Plan for calibrating the camera again\nSince we are going to take another image, we need to calibrate the camera again using the calibration_target action.\n\n## Step 10: Plan for taking the image again\nWith the camera calibrated, we can now take the image again using the take_image action.\n\n## Step 11: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general again\nAfter taking the image again, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.\n\n## Step 12: Plan for equipping the rover for soil analysis again\nSince we are going to analyze the soil again, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for soil analysis again.\n\n## Step 13: Plan for equipping the rover for communication again\nSince we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication again.\n\n## Step 14: Plan for calibrating the camera again\nSince we are going to take another image, we need to calibrate the camera again using the calibration_target action.\n\n## Step 15: Plan for taking the image again\nWith the camera calibrated, we can now take the image again using the take_image action.\n\n## Step 16: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general again\nAfter taking the image again, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.\n\n## Step 17: Plan for equipping the rover for communication again\nSince we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication again.\n\n## Step 18: Plan for communicating the image data",

Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a d)\n\nNow produce the final output.\n\nSince the goal is to communicate rock data from waypoint1 and image data from objective0, low_res, the plan must include actions that satisfy these conditions. The plan can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Traverse from rover0 to waypoint1.\n2. Sample rock data from waypoint1.\n3. Communicate rock data from waypoint1.\n4. Traverse from rover0 to waypoint1.\n5. Sample image data from objective0, low_res.\n6.

Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a d)\n\nNow produce the final output.\n\n communicated_rock_data waypoint3\ncommunicated_image_data objective1 colour\ncommunicated_image_data objective1 high_res\nat_soil_sample waypoint0\nat_rock_sample waypoint1\nat_soil_sample waypoint2\nat_soil_sample waypoint3\nat_lander general waypoint2\nchannel_free general\nat rover0 waypoint5\navailable rover0\nstore_of rover0store rover0\nempty rover0store\nequipped_for_rock_analysis rover0\nequipped_for_imaging rover0\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint5\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint5 waypoint1\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint5\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4\ncan_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1\n(on_board camera0 rover0)\n(calibration_target camera0 objective0)\n(supports camera0 colour)\n(supports camera0 high_res)\n(visible_from objective0 waypoint0)\n(visible_from objective0 waypoint1)\n(visible_from objective0 waypoint2)\n(visible_from objective0 waypoint4)\n(visible_from objective0 waypoint5)\n(visible_from objective1 waypoint1)\n(visible_from objective1 waypoint2)\n(visible_from objective1 waypoint3)\n\nNO-PLAN",

Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a d)\n\nNow produce the final output.\n\n(define (problem roverprob10566) (:domain Rover)\n(:objects\n\tgeneral -

Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a d)\n\nNow produce the final output.\n\ncommunicated_soil_data waypoint6\ncommunicated_soil_data waypoint5\ncommunicated_rock_data waypoint1\ncommunicated_image_data objective2 high_res\ncommunicated_image_data objective1 colour\ncommunicated_image_data objective0 low_res\ndrop rover1store\nsample_rock rover1 waypoint1\nsample_soil rover0 waypoint4\nnavigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2\nnavigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint5\nnavigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6\nat_soil_sample waypoint6\nat_rock_sample waypoint1\ncalibrate camera0 rover0\ntake_image rover0 waypoint6 objective2 high_res\ntake_image rover1 waypoint1 objective1 colour\ntake_image rover0 waypoint4 objective0 low_res",

      "raw_solution": "<DOMAIN>\n...</DOMAIN>\n\n<PROBLEM>\n...</PROBLEM>\n\n## Planning Rules\n1) Only use available symbols:\n   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and\n   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).\n   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a)\n\nPlan:\n(communicated_rock_data

      "raw_solution": "<DOMAIN>\n...</DOMAIN>\n\n<PROBLEM>\n...</PROBLEM>\n\n## Planning Rules\n1) Only use available symbols:\n   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and\n   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).\n   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.\n\n2) Constraints:\n   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.\n   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.\n\n3) Plan form:\n   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.\n\n4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):\n   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.\n   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.\n   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.\n\n## Output Requirements\n- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.\n- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`\n- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).\n- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.\n- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).\n- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`\n\n## Examples\nBad:\n- Plan:\n- Here is the plan:\n- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)\n- (move a) extra\n\nGood:\n(move a b)\n(pick a c)\n(drop a d)\n\nNow produce the final output.\n\n
