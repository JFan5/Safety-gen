</PROBLEM>

## Step 1: Analyze the problem and identify the goal
The goal is to communicate the image data from objective0 to the lander general using a camera. The camera is calibrated for low-res mode, and the rover is available at waypoint4.

## Step 2: Plan the sequence of actions
1. Move the rover to waypoint7.
2. Take an image using camera1 and objective2 at waypoint7.
3. Communicate the image data from the lander general.

## Step 3: Validate the plan
- The rover is available at waypoint4, and we can move it to waypoint7.
- The camera is calibrated for low-res mode, and we have an objective (objective2) at waypoint7.
- We can communicate the image data from the lander general.

The final answer is:

(move rover0 waypoint7)
(take_image camera1 objective2 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data general camera1 waypoint7)
