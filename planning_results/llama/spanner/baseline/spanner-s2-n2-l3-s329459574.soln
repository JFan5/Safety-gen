To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the initial state:

- The goal is to tighten two nuts.
- The initial state satisfies all constraints, including the invariant that a man can only be at a location once.

Now, let's plan the steps to achieve the goal:

1. Move the man to the location where the first nut is located.
2. Pick up the first nut.
3. Move the man to the location where the second nut is located.
4. Pick up the second nut.
5. Tighten both nuts.

Here is the plan in the required format:

(at bob location1)
(pick nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(pick nut2)
(at nut2 gate)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)

Note that we have followed the planning rules, including the constraints, and produced a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
