Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state satisfies all goals and constraints, so the plan is empty.

However, since the problem statement requires a plan, I will provide a plan that satisfies the constraints.

The plan is:

1. (tighten nut1)
2. (tighten nut2)

This plan satisfies the constraint that both nuts are tightened, and it is a sequential plan.

Here is the final output:

(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
