Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(tighten a b)
(pick c d)
(tighten c d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and the constraint that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Note that the plan only includes actions that are available in the domain, and it does not include any actions that would violate the invariants or safety constraints implied by the domain or problem.

Also, note that the plan is grounded, meaning that it does not include any variables or timestamps, and it is totally ordered, meaning that the actions are executed in a specific order.
