Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(pick a e)
(pick a f)
(pick a g)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(tighten e)
(tighten f)
(tighten g)

However, this plan is not optimal. We can simplify it by combining the actions.

Here is the simplified plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and the constraints of tightening nut 1 before nut 2.
