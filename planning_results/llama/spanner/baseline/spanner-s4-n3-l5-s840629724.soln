The problem provided is a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) problem, which is a type of planning problem used in artificial intelligence. The problem is defined in a specific format, with a domain and a problem statement.

To solve this problem, we need to generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan that satisfies the problem statement.

After analyzing the problem statement, we can see that the goal is to tighten three nuts (nut1, nut2, and nut3) by picking them up with a spanner and then tightening them.

Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the problem statement and the constraints provided in the problem.

Here is the final output:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)
