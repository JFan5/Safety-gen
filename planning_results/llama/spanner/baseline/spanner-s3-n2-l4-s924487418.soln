Here is the plan that satisfies the given conditions:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(pick nut2 shed)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the preconditions of the actions. It also satisfies the constraints that nut1 and nut2 are tightened.
