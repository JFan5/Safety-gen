Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 2 must come before the tightening of nut 3.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and also satisfies the constraint that the tightening of nut 2 comes before the tightening of nut 3.

Note that the plan involves picking up the nuts and then tightening them, which is a valid sequence of actions in this domain.

The final output is:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
