Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening must happen before the loosening of the nuts.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(tighten a)
(pick b c)
(tighten b)
(drop a)
(drop b)
(tighten c)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and the constraint that the tightening must happen before the loosening of the nuts.
