Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick a c)
(drop a d)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(tighten b c)
(tighten b d)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all nuts and the constraints of not tightening a nut more than once and not tightening a nut if it is already tightened.
