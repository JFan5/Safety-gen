To generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we will use a planning engine. Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain, and it also satisfies the goal of tightening both nuts.
