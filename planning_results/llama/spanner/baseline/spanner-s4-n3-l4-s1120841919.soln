Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten a c)
(tighten a d)
(drop a b)
(drop a c)
(drop a d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all nuts and ensures that the constraints are met.
