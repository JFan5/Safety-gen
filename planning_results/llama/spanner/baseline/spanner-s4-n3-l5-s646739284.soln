Using the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

After analyzing the problem, I have generated the following plan:

1. (walk bob location1 location2)
2. (walk bob location2 location3)
3. (walk bob location3 location4)
4. (walk bob location4 gate)
5. (walk bob gate shed)
6. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner1)
7. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner2)
8. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner3)
9. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut1)
10. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut2)
11. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut3)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals provided in the problem. It ensures that the nuts are tightened in the correct order, and the spanner is picked up and carried to the location where the nuts are tightened.

The final output is:

1. (walk bob location1 location2)
2. (walk bob location2 location3)
3. (walk bob location3 location4)
4. (walk bob location4 gate)
5. (walk bob gate shed)
6. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner1)
7. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner2)
8. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner3)
9. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut1)
10. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut2)
11. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut3)
