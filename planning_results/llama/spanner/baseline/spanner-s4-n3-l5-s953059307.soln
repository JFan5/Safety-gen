Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 2 must come before the tightening of nut 3.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick b c)
(pick c d)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and the constraint that the tightening of nut 2 comes before the tightening of nut 3.
