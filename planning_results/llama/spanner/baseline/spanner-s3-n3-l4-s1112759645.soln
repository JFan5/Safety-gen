The planning engine must produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input.

First, the planning rules provided must be respected:

1. Only use available symbols.
2. Constraints must be satisfied if they are present in the problem.
3. The plan must be sequential, grounded, and in the required output format.

Given the provided domain and problem, the problem is to tighten three nuts. The planning rules are satisfied by this goal.

The initial state already satisfies all constraints and goals.

Therefore, the output should be:
```
(NO-PLAN)
```
