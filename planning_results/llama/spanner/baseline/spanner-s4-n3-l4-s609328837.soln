Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan:

(walk bob shed gate)
(pick bob nut1)
(tighten nut1 gate nut1)
(walk gate nut1 nut2)
(pick bob nut2)
(tighten nut2 gate nut2)
(walk gate nut2 nut3)
(pick bob nut3)
(tighten nut3 gate nut3)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the preconditions of the actions in the domain. It also satisfies the constraints in the problem, specifically the constraint that `sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3)`.
