Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick bob nut2)
(pick bob nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and ensures that the constraints are met. The plan is grounded, sequential, and totally ordered, and it does not violate any invariants or safety constraints implied by the domain or problem.

Note that the plan does not include any actions that are not explicitly mentioned in the domain or problem, and it only uses available symbols as required.
