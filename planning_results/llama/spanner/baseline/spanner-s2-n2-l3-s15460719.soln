Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state satisfies all goals and constraints, so the output will be empty.

However, to demonstrate the planning process, I will provide a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick nut1 gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)

This plan satisfies the constraints and goals, but it may not be the optimal solution. The planning process can be complex, and there may be multiple valid plans.

Since the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints, the output will be empty.

Output:
```
(NO-PLAN)
```
