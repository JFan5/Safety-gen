Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan ensures that all nuts are tightened, which is the goal of the problem. It also satisfies the constraints that all nuts must be tightened before the next nut is tightened, and that no man can be in the shed at the same time.

Note that this plan is grounded and totally ordered, with no variables or timestamps. It also respects the typing and constraints of the domain and problem.
