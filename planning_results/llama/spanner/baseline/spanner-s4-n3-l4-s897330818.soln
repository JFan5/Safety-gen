Using the provided PDDL2 domain and problem, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

First, I will parse the problem and domain to extract the relevant information.

Domain:
(define (domain spanner)                    
(:requirements :typing :strips :constraints)      

(:types 
	location locatable - object
	man nut spanner - locatable	
)                                           
                                                                               
(:predicates 
	(at?m - locatable?l - location)
	(carrying?m - man?s - spanner)
	(useable?s - spanner)
	(link?l1 - location?l2 - location)
	(tightened?n - nut)
	(loose?n - nut))                                                                                           
(:action walk 
        :parameters (?start - location?end - location?m - man)
        :precondition (and (at?m?start) 
                           (link?start?end))                                                          
        :effect (and (not (at?m?start)) (at?m?end)))

(:action pickup_spanner 
        :parameters (?l - location?s - spanner?m - man)
        :precondition (and (at?m?l) 
                           (at?s?l))
        :effect (and (not (at?s?l))
                     (carrying?m?s)))

(:action tighten_nut 
        :parameters (?l - location?s - spanner?m - man?n - nut)
        :precondition (and (at?m?l) 
		      	   (at?n?l)
			   (carrying?m?s)
			   (useable?s)
			   (loose?n))
        :effect (and (not (loose?n))(not (useable?s)) (tightened?n)))
)
</DOMAIN>

    (link shed location1)
    (link location4 gate)
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
    (link location3 location4)
)
 (:goal
  (and
   (tightened nut1)
   (tightened nut2)
   (tightened nut3)
))
(:constraints
  (and
    (sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3))
    (forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at?m shed)))
  )
)
)

</PROBLEM>

Now, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

1. Pickup spanner1 from location3.
2. Pickup spanner2 from location3.
3. Pickup nut1 from gate.
4. Tighten nut1.
5. Pickup nut2 from gate.
6. Tighten nut2.
7. Pickup nut3 from gate.
8. Tighten nut3.
9. Walk from shed to gate.
10. Walk from gate to location4.
11. Walk from location4 to location3.
12. Walk from location3 to location2.
13. Walk from location2 to location1.
14. Walk from location1 to location3.
15. Walk from location3 to location2.
16. Walk from location2 to location3.
17. Walk from location3 to location4.
18. Walk from location4 to gate.
19. Walk from gate to shed.

The final output is:

1. (pickup_spanner spanner1 location3)
2. (pickup_spanner spanner2 location3)
3. (pickup_nut nut1 gate)
4. (tighten_nut nut1)
5. (pickup_nut nut2 gate)
6. (tighten_nut nut2)
7. (pickup_nut nut3 gate)
8. (tighten_nut nut3)
9. (walk bob shed gate)
10. (walk gate location4)
11. (walk location4 location3)
12. (walk location3 location2)
13. (walk location2 location1)
14. (walk location1 location3)
15. (walk location3 location2)
16. (walk location2 location3)
17. (walk location3 location4)
18. (walk location4 gate)
19. (walk gate shed)
