Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

After analyzing the problem, I have come up with a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals. Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(pick nut2 nut2)
(pick nut2 gate)
(pick nut3 gate)
(pick nut3 nut3)
(pick nut3 gate)
(drop nut1 nut1)
(drop nut2 nut2)
(drop nut3 nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem. It involves picking up the nuts, tightening them, and then dropping them back. The plan is grounded and totally ordered, with no variables or timestamps.
