Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will provide the output as requested:

```
NO-PLAN
```

This indicates that the task is unsatisfiable given the domain and problem, including any constraints.
