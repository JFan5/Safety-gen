Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to tighten all three nuts (nut1, nut2, and nut3) and satisfy the constraint that the tightening of nut1 must happen before nut2.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob)
(at bob gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(pick nut1)
(at nut1 shed)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)
(pick nut2)
(at nut2 shed)
(tighten nut3)

Note: This plan assumes that the actions can be performed in the given order and that the constraints can be satisfied. However, please note that the plan may not be the only possible solution, and it's always a good idea to validate the plan against the domain and problem to ensure that it meets all the requirements.

Also, please note that the plan does not include any additional actions to handle the fact that the constraints imply that the tightening of nut1 must happen before nut2. This is because the constraint is already satisfied by the plan, and adding additional actions would not change the outcome.

Here is the plan in the required format:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob)
(at bob gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(pick nut1)
(at nut1 shed)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)
(pick nut2)
(at nut2 shed)
(tighten nut3)
