To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the domain:

* The goal is to tighten three nuts (nut1, nut2, and nut3) by picking up a spanner and tightening it.
* The spanner is already in location3, and the nuts are loose at the gate.
* The constraints include the fact that the spanner can only be used once and that the nuts must be tightened in a specific order.

Here's a possible plan:

1. (pick spanner1)
2. (tighten nut1)
3. (pick spanner2)
4. (tighten nut2)
5. (pick spanner3)
6. (tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals, and it's a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

Here's the final output:

(pick spanner1)
(tighten nut1)
(pick spanner2)
(tighten nut2)
(pick spanner3)
(tighten nut3)
