Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening must happen before the loosening of the nuts.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(tighten a)
(pick b c)
(tighten b)
(drop b)
(pick c d)
(tighten c)
(drop c)
(pick d e)
(tighten d)
(drop d)
(pick e f)
(tighten e)
(drop e)
(pick f g)
(tighten f)
(drop f)
(pick g h)
(tighten g)
(drop g)
(pick h i)
(tighten h)
(drop h)
(pick i j)
(tighten i)
(drop i)
(pick j k)
(tighten j)
(drop j)
(pick k l)
(tighten k)
(drop k)
(pick l m)
(tighten l)
(drop l)
(pick m n)
(tighten m)
(drop m)
(pick n o)
(tighten n)
(drop n)
(pick o p)
(tighten o)
(drop o)
(pick p q)
(tighten p)
(drop p)
(pick q r)
(tighten q)
(drop q)
(pick r s)
(tighten r)
(drop r)
(pick s t)
(tighten s)
(drop s)
(pick t u)
(tighten t)
(drop t)
(pick u v)
(tighten u)
(drop u)
(pick v w)
(tighten v)
(drop v)
(pick w x)
(tighten w)
(drop w)
(pick x y)
(tighten x)
(drop x)
(pick y z)
(tighten y)
(drop y)
(pick z a)
(tighten z)
(drop z)

Note that this plan involves a large number of actions, and it may not be the most efficient solution. However, it satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the final output:

(pick a b)
(tighten a)
(pick b c)
(tighten b)
(drop b)
(pick c d)
(tighten c)
(drop c)
(pick d e)
(tighten d)
(drop d)
(pick e f)
(tighten e)
(drop e)
(pick f g)
(tighten f)
(drop f)
(pick g h)
(tighten g)
(drop g)
(pick h i)
(tighten h)
(drop h)
(pick i j)
(tighten i)
(drop i)
(pick j k)
(tighten j)
(drop j)
(pick k l)
(tighten k)
(drop k)
(pick l m)
(tighten l)
(drop l)
(pick m n)
(tighten m)
(drop m)
(pick n o)
(tighten n)
(drop n)
(pick o p)
(tighten o)
(drop o)
(pick p q)
(tighten p)
(drop p)
(pick q r)
(tighten q)
(drop q)
(pick r s)
(tighten r)
(drop r)
(pick s t)
(tighten s)
(drop s)
(pick t u)
(tighten t)
(drop t)
(pick u v)
(tighten u)
(drop u)
(pick v w)
(tighten v)
(drop v)
(pick w x)
(tighten w)
(drop w)
(pick x y)
(tighten x)
(drop x)
(pick y z)
(tighten y)
(drop y)
(pick z a)
(tighten z)
