Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick nut1 gate)
(drop nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(drop nut2 gate)
(pick nut2)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut1)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening both nuts and ensures that all constraints are met.
