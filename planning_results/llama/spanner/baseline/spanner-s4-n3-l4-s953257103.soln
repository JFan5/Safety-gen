To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the constraints:

- The goal is to tighten three nuts (nut1, nut2, and nut3).
- The constraints are that nut1 must be tightened before nut2, and that each man can be at most once in the shed.

Now, let's generate a plan:

1. Move the man bob to the shed.
2. Pick up the spanner from location1.
3. Tighten nut1.
4. Move the man bob to location2.
5. Pick up the spanner from location2.
6. Tighten nut2.
7. Move the man bob to location3.
8. Pick up the spanner from location3.
9. Tighten nut3.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of tightening the three nuts.

Here is the final output:

(move bob shed)
(pick spanner1 location1)
(tighten nut1)
(move bob location2)
(pick spanner2 location2)
(tighten nut2)
(move bob location3)
(pick spanner3 location3)
(tighten nut3)
