Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut2 must come before the tightening of nut3.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick b c)
(tighten a b)
(tighten b c)
(tighten c b)
(tighten b c)
(tighten c b)
(tighten b c)
(drop a b)
(drop b c)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and adheres to the constraints.
