Since the problem is to produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given domain and problem, we will generate a plan that satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain.

Here is the plan:

(pick bob nut1)
(pick bob nut2)
(pick bob nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan first picks up the nuts using the `pickup_spanner` action, then tightens them using the `tighten_nut` action.

Note that this plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain, and it is totally-ordered and grounded.
