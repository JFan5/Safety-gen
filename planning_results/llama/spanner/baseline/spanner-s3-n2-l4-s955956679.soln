Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The problem is to tighten two nuts, nut1 and nut2, which are loose and useable. The nuts are currently at the gate location, and the goal is to tighten them.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob)
(at bob gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)

This plan satisfies the constraints and goals by tightening both nuts, which are now at the gate location. The plan is sequential, grounded, and totally ordered.

Here is the output:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob)
(at bob gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)
