Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten three nuts: nut1, nut2, and nut3. The constraints are that nut1 must be tightened before nut2, and no man can be at the shed more than once.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(pick nut3 gate)
(drop nut1 shed)
(drop nut2 shed)
(drop nut3 shed)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the constraints and goals, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan with no variables or timestamps.
