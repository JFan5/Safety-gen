Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are satisfied by the initial state.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(pick nut3 gate)
(drop nut1 gate)
(drop nut2 gate)
(drop nut3 gate)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of tightening the nuts.
