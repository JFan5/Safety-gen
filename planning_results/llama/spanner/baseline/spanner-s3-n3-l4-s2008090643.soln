Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and also satisfies the constraints of the problem, including the constraint that tightening nut2 must come before tightening nut3.
