To solve this problem, I will use the given PDDL2 domain and problem to generate a plan. Since the problem statement is quite complex, I will first parse the domain and problem to extract the necessary information.

After parsing the domain and problem, I can see that the goal is to tighten the nuts in locations 1 and 2. To achieve this, we need to move the spanner to location 1 and then tighten the nuts.

Here is the plan:

(use spanner1)
(tighten nut1)
(use spanner2)
(tighten nut2)

Note that we need to use two spanners to tighten the two nuts, and we should always ensure that the preconditions of the actions are met before performing the actions.
