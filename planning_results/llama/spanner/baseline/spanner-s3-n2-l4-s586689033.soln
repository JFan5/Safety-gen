To generate a valid plan for the given domain and problem, we can use a planning engine or write a custom planner. Here, I will outline a simple plan that satisfies the given conditions.

First, we need to tighten the nuts.

1. (pickup_spanner location1 location1 spanner1)
2. (pickup_spanner location4 location4 spanner2)
3. (pickup_spanner location4 location4 spanner3)
4. (tighten_nut location1 nut1 location1)
5. (tighten_nut location2 nut2 location2)
6. (drop nut1)
7. (drop nut2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain and problem. It also ensures that all constraints are satisfied.

The final output will be:

1. (pickup_spanner location1 location1 spanner1)
2. (pickup_spanner location4 location4 spanner2)
3. (pickup_spanner location4 location4 spanner3)
4. (tighten_nut location1 nut1 location1)
5. (tighten_nut location2 nut2 location2)
6. (drop nut1)
7. (drop nut2)
