Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

First, I will parse the domain and problem to extract the relevant information.

Domain:
(define (domain spanner)                    
(:requirements :typing :strips :constraints)      

(:types 
	location locatable - object
	man nut spanner - locatable	
)                                           
                                                                               
(:predicates 
	(at?m - locatable?l - location)
	(carrying?m - man?s - spanner)
	(useable?s - spanner)
	(link?l1 - location?l2 - location)
	(tightened?n - nut)
	(loose?n - nut))                                                                                           
(:action walk 
        :parameters (?start - location?end - location?m - man)
        :precondition (and (at?m?start) 
                           (link?start?end))                                                          
        :effect (and (not (at?m?start)) (at?m?end)))

(:action pickup_spanner 
        :parameters (?l - location?s - spanner?m - man)
        :precondition (and (at?m?l) 
                           (at?s?l))
        :effect (and (not (at?s?l))
                     (carrying?m?s)))

(:action tighten_nut 
        :parameters (?l - location?s - spanner?m - man?n - nut)
        :precondition (and (at?m?l) 
		      	   (at?n?l)
			   (carrying?m?s)
			   (useable?s)
			   (loose?n))
        :effect (and (not (loose?n))(not (useable?s)) (tightened?n)))
)
</DOMAIN>

Problem:
(define (problem spanner-s2-n2-l3-s2048054551)
 (:domain spanner)
 (:objects 
     bob - man
     spanner1 spanner2 - spanner
     nut1 nut2 - nut
     location1 location2 location3 - location
    )
 (:init 
    (at bob shed)
    (at spanner1 location3)
    (useable spanner1)
    (at spanner2 location3)
    (useable spanner2)
    (loose nut1)
    (at nut1 gate)
    (loose nut2)
    (at nut2 gate)
    (link shed location1)
    (link location3 gate)
    (link location1 location2)
    (link location2 location3)
)
 (:goal
  (and
   (tightened nut1)
   (tightened nut2)
))
(:constraints
  (and
    (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2))
    (forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at?m shed)))
  )
)
)

Now, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

1. bob moves from shed to location1
2. bob picks up nut1 at location1
3. bob moves from location1 to gate
4. bob drops nut1 at gate
5. bob picks up nut2 at gate
6. bob moves from gate to location3
7. bob picks up spanner1 at location3
8. bob moves from location3 to location2
9. bob picks up spanner2 at location2
10. bob tightens nut1
11. bob tightens nut2

The final output is:

(move bob location1)
(pick bob nut1)
(move bob gate)
(drop bob nut1)
(pick bob nut2)
(move bob location3)
(pick bob spanner1)
(move bob location2)
(pick bob spanner2)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
