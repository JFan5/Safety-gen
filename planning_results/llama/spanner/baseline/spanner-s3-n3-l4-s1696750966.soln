Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and does not violate any constraints or invariants implied by the domain or problem.
