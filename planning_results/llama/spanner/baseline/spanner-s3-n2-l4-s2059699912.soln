Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will provide an empty plan:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Note that this is not a valid plan, as it does not contain any actions. The correct output should be:

NO-PLAN
