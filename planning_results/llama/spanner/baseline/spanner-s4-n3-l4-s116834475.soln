Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(drop a)
(drop b)
(drop c)
(drop d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and also satisfies the constraint that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Note that the plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and sequential, and it only uses available symbols as declared in the domain and problem.
