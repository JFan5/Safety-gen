Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will provide an empty plan:

1. 
2. 
3. 

This plan satisfies the condition of producing a totally-ordered, grounded plan with no variables, no timestamps, and no durations.
