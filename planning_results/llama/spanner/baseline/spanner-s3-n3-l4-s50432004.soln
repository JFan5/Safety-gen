To generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input provided, I'll analyze the problem and constraints.

Given the domain and problem, the goal is to tighten the nuts (nut1, nut2, and nut3) in the shed, which is initially loose. To achieve this, we need to first pick up the spanners (spanner1, spanner2, and spanner3) from their locations.

The constraints provided are:

- The nuts must be tightened in a specific order (sometime-before).
- Only one man can be in the shed at a time.

With these constraints in mind, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

(pick up spanner1)
(pick up spanner2)
(pick up spanner3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal of tightening the nuts in the shed.

Output:
(pick up spanner1)
(pick up spanner2)
(pick up spanner3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)
