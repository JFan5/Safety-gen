Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 2 must come before the tightening of nut 3.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick a c)
(pick a d)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(pick a e)
(pick a f)
(pick a g)
(tighten a)
(tighten b)
(tighten c)
(tighten d)
(tighten e)
(tighten f)
(tighten g)
(drop a)
(drop b)
(drop c)
(drop d)
(drop e)
(drop f)
(drop g)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all the nuts and the constraint that the tightening of nut 2 must come before the tightening of nut 3.
