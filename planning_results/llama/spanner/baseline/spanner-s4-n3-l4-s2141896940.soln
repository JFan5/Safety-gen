Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(at bob shed)
(pick bob nut1)
(pick nut1 gate)
(tighten nut1)
(at nut1 gate)
(pick nut2 gate)
(tighten nut2)
(at nut2 gate)
(pick nut3 gate)
(tighten nut3)
(at nut3 gate)
(drop nut1)
(drop nut2)
(drop nut3)
(at bob shed)
(drop bob)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and the constraints that each nut can only be tightened once.
