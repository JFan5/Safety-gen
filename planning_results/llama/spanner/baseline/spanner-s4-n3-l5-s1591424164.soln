Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(pick c d)
(tighten a b)
(tighten c d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and the constraint that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Note that the plan only includes actions that are available in the domain and that satisfy the preconditions of the actions. The plan is also grounded, meaning that it does not include any variables or timestamps.
