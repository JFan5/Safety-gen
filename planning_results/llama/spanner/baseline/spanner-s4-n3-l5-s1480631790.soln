Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The goal is to tighten the nuts, and the constraints are that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Here is the plan:

(pick a b)
(tighten a b)
(pick c d)
(tighten c d)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening the nuts and the constraint that the tightening of nut 1 must be before the tightening of nut 2.

Note: The plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and sequential, and it only uses available symbols as declared in the domain and problem.
