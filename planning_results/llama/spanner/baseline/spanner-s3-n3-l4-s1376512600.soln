Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The plan is as follows:

1. (walk bob shed location1)
2. (walk bob location1 gate)
3. (walk bob gate location4)
4. (walk bob location4 shed)
5. (pickup_spanner bob location1 spanner1)
6. (pickup_spanner bob location2 spanner2)
7. (pickup_spanner bob location3 spanner3)
8. (tighten_nut bob location1 nut1)
9. (tighten_nut bob location2 nut2)
10. (tighten_nut bob location3 nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem.
