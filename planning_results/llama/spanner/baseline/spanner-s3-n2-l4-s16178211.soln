Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The initial state satisfies all goals and constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, since the problem statement requires a plan, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals.

The plan is:

(no-plan)

This is because the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints, so there is no need to perform any actions.

If you would like, I can try to generate a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals, but in this case, the initial state is already optimal.

Please note that the plan is empty because the initial state is already optimal, and no further actions are required to satisfy the constraints and goals.
