The problem is a PDDL task that involves moving a spanner from one location to another, tightening nuts in the process. The task is defined in the domain and problem sections of the input.

To solve this problem, we can use a planning algorithm such as the LPG (Lazy Planning with Graphs) algorithm.

Here is the plan:
(pick spanner1)
(walk shed location1)
(pick nut1)
(tighten nut1)
(drop nut1)
(walk location1 location2)
(pick nut2)
(tighten nut2)
(drop nut2)
(walk location2 location3)
(pick nut3)
(tighten nut3)
(drop nut3)
(walk location3 location4)
(pick spanner2)
(walk location4 location5)
(pick nut4)
(tighten nut4)
(drop nut4)
(walk location5 gate)
(pick nut5)
(tighten nut5)
(drop nut5)

This plan involves 15 steps, which are as follows:

1. Pick up spanner1
2. Walk from shed to location1
3. Pick up nut1
4. Tighten nut1
5. Drop nut1
6. Walk from location1 to location2
7. Pick up nut2
8. Tighten nut2
9. Drop nut2
10. Walk from location2 to location3
11. Pick up nut3
12. Tighten nut3
13. Drop nut3
14. Walk from location3 to location4
15. Pick up spanner2
16. Walk from location4 to location5
17. Pick up nut4
18. Tighten nut4
19. Drop nut4
20. Walk from location5 to gate
21. Pick up nut5
22. Tighten nut5
23. Drop nut5
