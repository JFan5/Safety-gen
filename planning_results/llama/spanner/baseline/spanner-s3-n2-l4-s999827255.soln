Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so the output will be **nothing**.

However, since the problem statement requires a plan to be produced, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints.

After analyzing the problem, I found a possible plan:

1. (tighten nut1)
2. (tighten nut2)
3. (loose nut1)
4. (loose nut2)

This plan satisfies the constraints and goals, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.

Here is the final output:

(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(loose nut1)
(loose nut2)
