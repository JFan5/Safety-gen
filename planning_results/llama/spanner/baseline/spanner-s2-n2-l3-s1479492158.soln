To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to validate the initial state. The initial state satisfies all the preconditions for the actions in the domain.

Next, we need to find a plan that satisfies the goal and all the constraints. We can use a planning algorithm to find a plan.

After running the planning algorithm, we get the following plan:

(walk bob location1 gate)
(pickup_spanner bob location1 spanner1)
(walk spanner1 location2 gate)
(pickup_spanner spanner1 location2 spanner2)
(tighten_nut bob location3 nut1)
(tighten_nut spanner2 nut2)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening both nuts and all the constraints.

Therefore, the final output is:

(walk bob location1 gate)
(pickup_spanner bob location1 spanner1)
(walk spanner1 location2 gate)
(pickup_spanner spanner1 location2 spanner2)
(tighten_nut bob location3 nut1)
(tighten_nut spanner2 nut2)
