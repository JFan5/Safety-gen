Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick nut1)
(pick nut2)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening both nuts and ensures that the constraints are met. The plan is grounded, sequential, and totally ordered, and it does not violate any invariants or safety constraints implied by the domain or problem.
