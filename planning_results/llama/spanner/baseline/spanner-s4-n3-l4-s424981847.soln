Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (walk bob location1 location2)
2. (walk bob location2 location3)
3. (walk bob location3 location4)
4. (walk bob gate location4)
5. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner1)
6. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner2)
7. (pickup_spanner bob location4 spanner3)
8. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut1)
9. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut2)
10. (tighten_nut bob location4 nut3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the constraints of the problem, including the constraint that the nut is tightened before the spanner is used.
