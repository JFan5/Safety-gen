Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

Here is the plan:

(pick bob nut1)
(pick bob nut2)
(pick bob nut3)
(tighten nut1)
(tighten nut2)
(tighten nut3)

This plan satisfies the goal of tightening all three nuts and ensures that the constraints are met. The plan is grounded, sequential, and totally ordered, and it only uses available symbols as declared in the domain and problem.
