Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(at c0 l1)
(at c1 l2)
(at c2 l0)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the cars to their respective locations.

Note that the plan is grounded and totally ordered, with no variables or timestamps. The plan also satisfies all the constraints in the problem.

The output will be:

(at c0 l1)
(at c1 l2)
(at c2 l0)
