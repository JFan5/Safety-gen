To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to analyze the domain and problem.

We can start by initializing the state with the given objects and locations.

(define (problem ferry-l4-c3)
(:domain ferry)
(:objects l0 l1 l2 l3 
          c0 c1 c2 
)
(:init
(location l0)
(location l1)
(location l2)
(location l3)
(car c0)
(car c1)
(car c2)
(not-eq l0 l1)
(not-eq l1 l0)
(not-eq l0 l2)
(not-eq l2 l0)
(not-eq l0 l3)
(not-eq l3 l0)
(not-eq l1 l2)
(not-eq l2 l1)
(not-eq l1 l3)
(not-eq l3 l1)
(not-eq l2 l3)
(not-eq l3 l2)
(empty-ferry)
(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l0)
(at c2 l0)
(at-ferry l2)
)
(:goal
(and
(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l2)
(at c2 l3)
)
)

(:constraints
  (and
    (sometime-before  (at c1 l2) (at-ferry l1))
    (sometime-before  (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l1))
  )
)
)

Now, we can plan the actions as follows:

1. Move c1 to l2
2. Move c2 to l3
3. Move c0 to l3

These actions satisfy the given goals and constraints.

Here is the final plan:

(move c1 l2)
(move c2 l3)
(move c0 l3)

This plan is grounded and totally-ordered, and it satisfies the given domain and problem.
