Since the problem does not provide a direct solution, we can attempt to solve it by analyzing the domain and problem.

The goal is to move car c0 from location l5 to location l1, and car c1 from location l5 to location l1.

To achieve this, we can first sail car c0 from location l5 to location l3, and sail car c1 from location l5 to location l1.

Then, we can board car c0 on the ferry at location l3 and debark it at location l1.

Finally, we can board car c1 on the ferry at location l1 and debark it at location l1.

Here is the final output:

(sail l3 l1)
(sail l5 l1)
(board c0 l3)
(debark c0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
