Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l3, car c1 to location l2, and car c2 to location l3.

The constraints are:

- At c0 must be before at-ferry l0
- At c1 must be before at-ferry l1
- At c2 must be before at-ferry l0

Here is the plan:

(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l2)
(at c2 l3)

This plan satisfies the goal and constraints.
