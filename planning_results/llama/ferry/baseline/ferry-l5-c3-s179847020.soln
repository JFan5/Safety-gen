To generate the plan for the given domain and problem, we need to follow the planning rules and produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

The problem is to move an object from one location to another, while satisfying the given constraints and preconditions.

Here is the plan:

(debark c0 l0)
(debark c2 l2)
(board c1 l3)
(board c0 l0)
(board c2 l2)
(board c1 l3)
(debark c1 l3)
(debark c0 l0)

Note that this plan consists of 8 steps, each of which satisfies the preconditions and constraints of the problem.
