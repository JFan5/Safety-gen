Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l3)
(board c1 l4)
(debark c0 l4)
(debark c1 l4)
(debark c2 l2)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l4, car c1 to location l4, and car c2 to location l2, while also satisfying the constraints that car c0 was at location l3 before sailing to location l1, and car c1 was at location l4 before sailing to location l4.
