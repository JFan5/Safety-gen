Based on the provided domain and problem, the goal is to move car c0 to location l0 and car c1 to location l5. The constraints state that c0 must be at ferry l3 before c1 is at ferry l0, and c1 must be at ferry l5 before c0 is at ferry l0.

Here is a valid plan that satisfies the constraints and the goal:

(at c0 l2)
(at c1 l3)
(sail l2 l5)
(board c1 l5)
(debark c1 l5)
(debark c0 l0)
(board c0 l0)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the constraints and the goal.
