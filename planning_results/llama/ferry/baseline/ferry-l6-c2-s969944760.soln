Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan.

First, I will check if the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints. In this case, the initial state does not satisfy the goal of having car c0 at ferry l4, so I will start planning.

The first step is to move car c0 to ferry l4.

1. (sail l0 l4)
2. (board c0 l4)
3. (debarc c0 l4)

Now, I need to move car c1 to ferry l5.

1. (sail l1 l5)
2. (board c1 l5)
3. (debarc c1 l5)

The plan is now complete.

Here is the final output:

(sail l0 l4)
(board c0 l4)
(debarc c0 l4)
(sail l1 l5)
(board c1 l5)
(debarc c1 l5)
