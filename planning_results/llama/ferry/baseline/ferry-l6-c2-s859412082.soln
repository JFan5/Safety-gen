Here is the plan that satisfies the given problem:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c0 l3)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c1 l4)
(sail l4 l5)
(debark c0 l5)
(debark c1 l5)

This plan is grounded, totally-ordered, and satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions in the domain. It also satisfies the goal of having both cars at the final location.
