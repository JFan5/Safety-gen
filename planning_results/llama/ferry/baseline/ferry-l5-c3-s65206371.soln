Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (sail l1 l2)
3. (sail l2 l3)
4. (sail l3 l4)
5. (board c0 l3)
6. (board c1 l4)
7. (board c2 l2)
8. (debark c0 l3)
9. (debark c1 l4)
10. (debark c2 l2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving the cars to the desired locations.
