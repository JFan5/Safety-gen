To generate the plan, we need to apply the actions in the given domain and problem. Let's break down the steps:

1. We start with the initial state: `location l0`, `location l1`, `location l2`, `car c0`, `car c1`, `car c2`, and so on.

2. Our goal is to move `c0` to `l1`, `c1` to `l1`, and `c2` to `l2`.

3. We also have constraints: `sometime-before  (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)` and `sometime-before  (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l0)`.

4. Now, we can apply the actions:

- `(sail l0 l1)` moves `c0` from `l0` to `l1`.
- `(sail l1 l2)` moves `c1` from `l1` to `l2`.
- `(sail l2 l0)` moves `c2` from `l2` to `l0`.
- `(board c0 l1)` boards `c0` from `l1` to `l1`.
- `(board c1 l1)` boards `c1` from `l1` to `l1`.
- `(board c2 l2)` boards `c2` from `l2` to `l2`.
- `(debark c0 l1)` deboards `c0` from `l1` to `l1`.
- `(debark c1 l1)` deboards `c1` from `l1` to `l1`.
- `(debark c2 l2)` deboards `c2` from `l2` to `l2`.

So, the final output is:

(move l0 l1)
(move l1 l2)
(move l2 l0)
(board l1 l1)
(board l1 l1)
(board l2 l2)
(debark l1 l1)
(debark l1 l1)
(debark l2 l2)
