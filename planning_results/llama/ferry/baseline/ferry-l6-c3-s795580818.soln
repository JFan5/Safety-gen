Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints:

(sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0))
(sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1))

Since these constraints are satisfied, the output will be nothing.

But to follow the instructions, I will generate a plan that satisfies the constraints:

(move c0 l1)
(move c1 l0)

This plan satisfies the constraints, so the output will be:

(move c0 l1)
(move c1 l0)
