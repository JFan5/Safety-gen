Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

First, I will check if the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints. In this case, the initial state does not satisfy all the goals.

Next, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l2)
(debark c0 l4)
(debark c1 l1)
(debark c2 l3)

This plan satisfies all the goals and constraints. Therefore, the final output is:

(sail l0 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l2)
(debark c0 l4)
(debark c1 l1)
(debark c2 l3)
