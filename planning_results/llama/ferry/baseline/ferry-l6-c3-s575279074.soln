To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we will follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to parse the domain and problem, and then we can start planning.

The domain is:
```
(define (domain ferry)
  (:requirements :strips :constraints :negative-preconditions)
   (:predicates (not-eq?x?y)
		(car?c)
		(location?l)
		(at-ferry?l)
		(at?c?l)
		(empty-ferry)
		(on?c))

   (:action sail
       :parameters  (?from?to)
       :precondition (and (not-eq?from?to) 
                          (location?from) (location?to) (at-ferry?from))
       :effect (and  (at-ferry?to)
		     (not (at-ferry?from))))
   
   (:action board
       :parameters (?car?loc)
       :precondition  (and  (car?car) (location?loc)
			    (at?car?loc) (at-ferry?loc) (empty-ferry))
       :effect (and (on?car)
		    (not (at?car?loc)) 
		    (not (empty-ferry))))
   
   (:action debark
       :parameters  (?car ?loc)
       :precondition  (and  (car?car) (location?loc)
			    (on?car) (at-ferry?loc))
       :effect (and (at?car?loc)
		    (empty-ferry)
		    (not (on?car)))))
```

The problem is:
```
(define (problem ferry-l6-c3)
(:domain ferry)
(:objects l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 
          c0 c1 c2 
)
(:init
(location l0)
(location l1)
(location l2)
(location l3)
(location l4)
(location l5)
(car c0)
(car c1)
(car c2)
(not-eq l0 l1)
(not-eq l1 l0)
(not-eq l0 l2)
(not-eq l2 l0)
(not-eq l0 l3)
(not-eq l3 l0)
(not-eq l0 l4)
(not-eq l4 l0)
(not-eq l0 l5)
(not-eq l5 l0)
(not-eq l1 l2)
(not-eq l2 l1)
(not-eq l1 l3)
(not-eq l3 l1)
(not-eq l1 l4)
(not-eq l4 l1)
(not-eq l1 l5)
(not-eq l5 l1)
(not-eq l2 l3)
(not-eq l3 l2)
(not-eq l2 l4)
(not-eq l4 l2)
(not-eq l2 l5)
(not-eq l5 l2)
(not-eq l3 l4)
(not-eq l4 l3)
(not-eq l3 l5)
(not-eq l5 l3)
(not-eq l4 l5)
(not-eq l5 l4)
(empty-ferry)
(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l0)
(at c2 l4)
(at-ferry l1)
)
(:goal
(and
(at c0 l2)
(at c1 l4)
(at c2 l1)
)
)

(:constraints
  (and
    (sometime-before  (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0))
    (sometime-before  (at c1 l4) (at-ferry l2))
    (sometime-before  (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0))
  )
)
)
```

Now, we can start planning.

We have the following goals:
- (at c0 l2)
- (at c1 l4)
- (at c2 l1)

We also have the following constraints:
- (sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0))
- (sometime-before (at c1 l4) (at-ferry l2))
- (sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0))

We can start by trying to satisfy the first goal.

We can do this by using the sail action to move c0 from l0 to l2.

We can then use the debark action to move c0 from l2 to l0.
