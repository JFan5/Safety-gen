Using the provided plan form and planning rules, we can generate a valid plan for the given problem.

First, let's analyze the problem:

* The goal is to move the car "a" to the location "l1" and the car "c1" to the location "l4".
* There is a constraint that "c0" is currently at location "l3" and "c1" is currently at location "l0".

Using the action "sail", we can move "c0" to location "l1". To do this, we need to first move "c0" to location "l0", which can be done using the action "board". 

The plan is:

(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(at c0 l1)
(sail c0 l1)

Now, let's analyze the second part of the goal: move "c1" to location "l4". We can use the action "sail" to move "c1" to location "l4".

The plan is:

(at c0 l1)
(at c1 l0)
(sail c1 l4)

The final plan is:

(at c0 l1)
(sail c0 l1)
(sail c1 l4)

Here is the final plan in the required format:

move a l1
sail a l1
sail c1 l4
