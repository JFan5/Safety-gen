To generate the plan, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided in the problem.

First, we need to satisfy the constraints:

- (sometime-before  (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1))
- (sometime-before  (at c1 l5) (at-ferry l0))
- (sometime-before  (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0))

We can satisfy these constraints by moving the cars to the correct locations:

- Move car c0 to location l0
- Move car c1 to location l5
- Move car c2 to location l1

Now, we need to satisfy the goal:

- (at c0 l0)
- (at c1 l5)
- (at c2 l1)

We can satisfy this goal by moving the cars to the correct locations:

- Move car c0 to location l0
- Move car c1 to location l5
- Move car c2 to location l1

Therefore, the final plan is:

(move c0 l0)
(move c1 l5)
(move c2 l1)
