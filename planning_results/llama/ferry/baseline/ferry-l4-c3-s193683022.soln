Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l1, car c1 to location l0, and car c2 to location l1.

The constraints are:

- The ferry must be at location l1 before car c1 is moved to location l0.
- The ferry must be at location l0 before car c2 is moved to location l1.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(debark c1 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(debark c2 l1)

This plan satisfies all the goals and constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
