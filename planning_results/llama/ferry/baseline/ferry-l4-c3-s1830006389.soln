Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goals and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(debark c1 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c2 l3)
(debark c2 l3)

This plan consists of 8 steps and satisfies the goals and constraints provided in the problem.
