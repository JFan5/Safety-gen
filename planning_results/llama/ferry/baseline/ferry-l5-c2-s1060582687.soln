Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l0 l1
2. sail l1 l2
3. sail l2 l3
4. sail l3 l4
5. board c0 l3
6. board c1 l1
7. debark c0 l3
8. debark c1 l1

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l3 and car c1 to location l1, while also satisfying the constraints that the sail actions must occur before the board actions.
