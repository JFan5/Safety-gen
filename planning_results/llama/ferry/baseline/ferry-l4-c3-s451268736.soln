Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l3)
(board c2 l2)
(debark c0 l0)
(debark c1 l3)
(debark c2 l2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
