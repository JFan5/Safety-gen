Since the problem is to produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we will follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), so the output should be **nothing**.

However, let's verify this by checking the constraints:

(:constraints
  (sometime-before  (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l2))
)

Since the initial state already satisfies this constraint (at c2 l1), we can conclude that the problem is indeed satisfiable, and the output should be **nothing**.

Here is the final output:

```
```

Note that the output is empty, indicating that the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints.
