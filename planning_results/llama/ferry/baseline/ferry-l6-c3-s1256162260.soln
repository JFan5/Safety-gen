Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, to follow the instructions, I will provide an empty output:

```
```

This indicates that the task is unsatisfiable given the domain and problem, and no plan can be generated.
