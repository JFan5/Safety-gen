Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (sail l1 l2)
3. (sail l2 l3)
4. (sail l3 l4)
5. (board c0 l3)
6. (board c1 l0)
7. (board c2 l1)
8. (debark c0 l4)
9. (debark c1 l3)
10. (debark c2 l2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving the cars from l0 to l4, l1 to l3, and l2 to l3.
