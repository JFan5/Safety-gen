Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (sail l1 l2)
3. (sail l2 l4)
4. (board c0 l0)
5. (board c1 l2)
6. (board c2 l4)
7. (debar c0 l0)
8. (debar c1 l2)
9. (debar c2 l4)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
