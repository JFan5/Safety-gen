Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l0 l2
2. sail l2 l4
3. sail l4 l0
4. board c0 l2
5. board c1 l4
6. debark c0 l2
7. debark c1 l4

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l2 and car c1 to location l0, while also satisfying the constraints that car c0 was at location l3 and car c1 was at location l4 before the start of the plan.
