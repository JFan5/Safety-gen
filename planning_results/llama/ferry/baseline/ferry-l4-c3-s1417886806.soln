Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The initial state satisfies all goals and constraints, so the output will be nothing.

However, let's analyze the problem to see if we can generate a plan.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l3, car c1 to location l1, and car c2 to location l1.

The constraints are:

- (sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l2))
- (sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0))

To satisfy these constraints, we need to move the cars in a way that respects the constraints.

Here's a possible plan:

(at c0 l0)
(at c1 l1)
(at c2 l2)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c2 l1)

This plan satisfies the constraints and achieves the goal.

Here is the output:

(at c0 l0)
(at c1 l1)
(at c2 l2)
(sail l0 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c2 l1)
