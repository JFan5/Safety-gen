Based on the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

First, we need to adjust the state to reflect the movement of the cars:
- (board a b)
- (board c d)
- (sail b d)
- (sail c b)
- (sail d c)
- (board d a)
- (sail a d)
- (sail d b)
- (sail a c)

This plan ensures that all constraints and preconditions are satisfied, and the goal is achieved.

Here is the output in the required format:

(board a b)
(board c d)
(sail b d)
(sail c b)
(sail d c)
(board d a)
(sail a d)
(sail d b)
(sail a c)
