Based on the given domain and problem, here's a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan that satisfies all the preconditions and constraints:

(sail l4 l5)
(sail l5 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(board c1 l4)
(debark c1 l0)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c0 l2)

Note: This plan first takes the cars from l4 and l5 to l5 and l1 respectively, then boards them on l1 and l4, and then debarks them from l0, l3, and l2, respectively.
