Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l2)
(sail l0 l4)
(board c0 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(board c2 l1)
(debark c0 l2)
(debark c1 l2)
(debark c2 l1)

This plan ensures that the ferry sails from l0 to l2 and l0 to l4, then boards the cars c0, c1, and c2 at l2, l2, and l1, respectively, and debarks them at l2, l2, and l1, respectively.
