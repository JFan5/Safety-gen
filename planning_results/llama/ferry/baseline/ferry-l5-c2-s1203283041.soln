Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (board c0 l0)
3. (board c1 l1)
4. (debark c1 l1)
5. (debark c0 l0)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l0 and car c1 to location l1, while also satisfying the constraints that car c0 must be on ferry l0 before car c1 is on ferry l1.
