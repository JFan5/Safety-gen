To generate the plan, we will use the provided domain and problem. The goal is to move car c0 to location l3 and car c1 to location l0.

First, we will move car c0 to location l3 using the'sail' action:

(at c0 l3)

Next, we will move car c1 to location l0 using the'sail' action:

(at c1 l0)

However, the problem statement includes a constraint that the'sail' action must happen before the 'board' action for car c1. So, we need to move car c1 to location l5 first and then move it to location l0.

First, we will move car c1 to location l5 using the'sail' action:

(at c1 l5)

Next, we will move car c1 to location l0 using the'sail' action:

(at c1 l0)

Now, we have moved car c1 to location l0, which is the goal. We can move car c0 to location l3 using the'sail' action:

(at c0 l3)

Here is the final plan:

(move c0 l3)
(move c1 l5)
(move c1 l0)
(move c0 l3)

However, the plan should be in a more formal format. Here is the final plan in a more formal format:

(move c0 l3)
(board c1 l5)
(sail c1 l0)
(sail c0 l3)
