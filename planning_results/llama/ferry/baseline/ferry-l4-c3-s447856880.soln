To generate a plan for the given problem, we need to analyze the problem and the domain, and then apply the planning rules.

The problem is to move car c0 to location l2, car c1 to location l0, and car c2 to location l3, while satisfying the constraints.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(sail l1 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c2 l3)

This plan satisfies the goal and the constraints, and it is a grounded, totally-ordered plan.
