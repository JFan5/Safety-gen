Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l1 l5
2. sail l2 l0
3. board c0 l5
4. board c1 l0
5. debark c0 l5
6. debark c1 l0

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l5 and car c1 to location l0, while also satisfying the constraints that car c0 must be at location l5 before ferry l0 and car c1 must be at location l0 before ferry l2.
