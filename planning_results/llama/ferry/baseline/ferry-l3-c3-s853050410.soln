Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l0 l1
2. sail l1 l2
3. board c0 l2
4. board c1 l1
5. debark c0 l2
6. debark c1 l1
7. board c2 l1
8. board c0 l0
9. debark c2 l1
10. debark c1 l0
11. debark c0 l1

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having c0 at l2, c1 at l0, and c2 at l1.
