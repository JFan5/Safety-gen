To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to check if the problem is satisfiable. Since there are no constraints in the problem, we can proceed with goal-directed planning.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l2 and car c1 to location l4. We also need to ensure that the ferry is empty after the move.

Here's a possible plan:

1. sail l0 l2
2. sail l3 l4
3. board c0 l2
4. board c1 l4
5. debark c0 l2
6. debark c1 l4
7. board c0 l2
8. board c1 l4
9. debark c0 l2
10. debark c1 l4

However, this plan is not optimal. We can simplify it by removing the unnecessary steps.

Here's the simplified plan:

1. sail l0 l2
2. board c0 l2
3. sail l3 l4
4. board c1 l4
5. debark c0 l2
6. debark c1 l4

This plan satisfies the goal and the constraints, and it's also grounded and totally-ordered.

Therefore, the final output is:

(sail l0 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c1 l4)
(debark c0 l2)
(debark c1 l4)
