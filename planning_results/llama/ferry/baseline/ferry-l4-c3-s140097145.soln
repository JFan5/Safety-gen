Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The problem is to move car c0 from location l3 to location l3, car c1 from location l2 to location l3, and car c2 from location l0 to location l1.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c1 l3)
(debark c2 l1)

This plan satisfies the goal of moving the cars to their desired locations and also satisfies the constraints that the cars must be moved before the ferry arrives at their destination.
