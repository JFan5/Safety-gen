Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l0 l1
2. sail l1 l2
3. board c0 l0
4. board c1 l2
5. debark c0 l0
6. debark c1 l2

This plan satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l0 and car c1 to location l0, while also satisfying the constraints that car c0 must be on ferry l0 before car c1 is on ferry l2, and car c1 must be on ferry l2 before car c0 is on ferry l0.
