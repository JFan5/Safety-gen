To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to check if the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints. In this case, the initial state already satisfies the goal and the constraints.

Since the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints, we can output nothing.

However, to follow the planning rules, we need to output a message indicating that the task is unsatisfiable.

So, the final output will be:

NO-PLAN
