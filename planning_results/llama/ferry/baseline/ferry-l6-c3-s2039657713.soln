Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

First, I will parse the problem and identify the initial state and goals.

Initial state:
- Location of car c0: l2
- Location of car c1: l0
- Location of car c2: l4
- Ferry is empty
- Ferry is at l2

Goals:
- Move car c0 to l0
- Move car c1 to l4
- Move car c2 to l3

Constraints:
- At c0 must be before at-ferry l1
- At c1 must be before at-ferry l1
- At c2 must be before at-ferry l0

Now, I will generate a plan that satisfies the goals and constraints.

1. Move car c0 to l1 (satisfies constraint: at c0 must be before at-ferry l1)
2. Move car c1 to l2 (satisfies constraint: at c1 must be before at-ferry l1)
3. Move car c2 to l3 (satisfies constraint: at c2 must be before at-ferry l0)
4. Move car c0 to l0 (satisfies goal: move car c0 to l0)
5. Move car c1 to l4 (satisfies goal: move car c1 to l4)
6. Move car c2 to l3 (satisfies goal: move car c2 to l3)

The final plan is:
(move c0 l1)
(move c1 l2)
(move c2 l3)
(move c0 l0)
(move c1 l4)
(move c2 l3)

Note that this plan satisfies all the goals and constraints, and it is a grounded and totally-ordered plan.
