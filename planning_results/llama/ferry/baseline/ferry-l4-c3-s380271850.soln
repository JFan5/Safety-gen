Using the provided domain and problem, we can generate a plan to satisfy the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l3, car c1 to location l2, and car c2 to location l2.

Here's the plan:

(sail l0 l2)
(board c0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(sail l2 l1)
(board c1 l2)
(debark c1 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c2 l3)
(debark c2 l3)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving the cars to the desired locations.
