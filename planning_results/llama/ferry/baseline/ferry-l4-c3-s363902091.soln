To produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to check if the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints. In this case, the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints.

Since the initial state satisfies all goals and constraints, we can output nothing.

However, to follow the planning rules, we need to output a message indicating that the task is unsatisfiable. In this case, we can output:

NO-PLAN

Here is the final output:

NO-PLAN
