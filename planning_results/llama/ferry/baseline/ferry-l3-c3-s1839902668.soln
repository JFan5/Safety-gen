Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (board c0 l1)
3. (board c1 l1)
4. (board c2 l1)
5. (board c2 l2)
6. (debark c2 l2)
7. (debark c1 l2)
8. (debark c0 l2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having cars at locations l2, l1, and l0. Additionally, it satisfies the constraint that there is a ferry at location l0 before car c2 is at location l1.
