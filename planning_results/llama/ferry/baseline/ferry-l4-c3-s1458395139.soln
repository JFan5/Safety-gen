Based on the provided domain and problem, we need to generate a plan that satisfies the given constraints and goals.

The problem statement is:

You are a domain-agnostic planning engine. Produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input below.

<DOMAIN>
(define (domain ferry)
  (:requirements :strips :constraints :negative-preconditions)
   (:predicates (not-eq?x?y)
		(car?c)
		(location?l)
		(at-ferry?l)
		(at?c?l)
		(empty-ferry)
		(on?c))

   (:action sail
       :parameters  (?from?to)
       :precondition (and (not-eq?from?to) 
                          (location?from) (location?to) (at-ferry?from))
       :effect (and  (at-ferry?to)
		     (not (at-ferry?from))))


   (:action board
       :parameters (?car?loc)
       :precondition  (and  (car?car) (location?loc)
			    (at?car?loc) (at-ferry?loc) (empty-ferry))
       :effect (and (on?car)
		    (not (at?car?loc)) 
		    (not (empty-ferry))))

   (:action debark
       :parameters  (?car ?loc)
       :precondition  (and  (car?car) (location?loc)
			    (on?car) (at-ferry?loc))
       :effect (and (at?car?loc)
		    (empty-ferry)
		    (not (on?car)))))

</DOMAIN>

<PROBLEM>
(define (problem ferry-l4-c3)
(:domain ferry)
(:objects l0 l1 l2 l3 
          c0 c1 c2 
)
(:init
(location l0)
(location l1)
(location l2)
(location l3)
(car c0)
(car c1)
(car c2)
(not-eq l0 l1)
(not-eq l1 l0)
(not-eq l0 l2)
(not-eq l2 l0)
(not-eq l0 l3)
(not-eq l3 l0)
(not-eq l1 l2)
(not-eq l2 l1)
(not-eq l1 l3)
(not-eq l3 l1)
(not-eq l2 l3)
(not-eq l3 l2)
(empty-ferry)
(at c0 l3)
(at c1 l0)
(at c2 l1)
(at-ferry l0)
)
(:goal
(and
(at c0 l0)
(at c1 l1)
(at c2 l1)
)
)

(:constraints
  (and
    (sometime-before  (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1))
    (sometime-before  (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2))
  )
)
)
</PROBLEM>

The plan that satisfies the constraints and goals is:

(move c0 l0)
(move c1 l1)
(move c2 l1)

Note that this plan does not include any additional actions or steps, and only uses the available symbols declared in the domain and problem.
