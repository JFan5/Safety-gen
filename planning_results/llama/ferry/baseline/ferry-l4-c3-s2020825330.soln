Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

(sail l0 l3)
(board c0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(board c1 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(debark c2 l0)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
