Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l2)
2. (board c0 l2)
3. (sail l2 l1)
4. (board c1 l1)
5. (sail l1 l4)
6. (board c0 l4)
7. (sail l4 l2)
8. (board c1 l2)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of having c0 at l4 and c1 at l2.
