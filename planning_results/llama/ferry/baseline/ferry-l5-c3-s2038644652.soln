Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The problem is to move car c0 to location l0, car c1 to location l1, and car c2 to location l0.

Here is the plan:

(sail l3 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(sail l1 l0)
(board c1 l1)
(sail l4 l1)
(board c2 l4)
(sail l3 l1)
(board c0 l3)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c1 l0)
(sail l1 l0)
(board c2 l1)

Note that this plan involves multiple actions and car movements to satisfy the given goals and constraints.
