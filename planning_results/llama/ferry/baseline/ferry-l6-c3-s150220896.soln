Based on the provided domain and problem, I will generate a plan that satisfies the given goals and constraints.

The goal is to move car c0 to location l1, car c1 to location l1, and car c2 to location l4.

The constraints are:
- At some point before car c0 is at location l1, car c0 must be at location l0.
- At some point before car c2 is at location l4, car c2 must be at location l0.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l2)
(debark c2 l4)

This plan satisfies the given goals and constraints.
