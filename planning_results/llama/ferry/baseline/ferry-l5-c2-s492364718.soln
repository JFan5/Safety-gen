Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. (sail l0 l1)
2. (board c0 l2)
3. (board c1 l2)
4. (sail l2 l4)
5. (sail l1 l4)
6. (debark c0 l4)
7. (debark c1 l1)

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of moving car c0 to location l4 and car c1 to location l1.
