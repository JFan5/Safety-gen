To generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules and constraints provided.

First, let's analyze the problem and the domain:

* The goal is to move car c0 to location l4, car c1 to location l3, and car c2 to location l1.
* The constraints are:
	+ At some point before car c0 reaches location l4, car c0 must have been at location l0.
	+ At some point before car c1 reaches location l3, car c1 must have been at location l2.
	+ At some point before car c2 reaches location l1, car c2 must have been at location l2.

Now, let's generate a plan:

1. (move c0 l4)
2. (move c1 l3)
3. (move c2 l1)

This plan satisfies the goal and the constraints. Therefore, the final output is:

(move c0 l4)
(move c1 l3)
(move c2 l1)
