Here's the output of the plan:

(move a l1)
(board a l2)
(debark a l0)
(move c l2)
(board c l0)
(debark c l1)

Note that the plan involves moving an object (a) from l0 to l1, then moving another object (c) from l1 to l2, and then debarking (moving off) the object c from l2 back to l1. The object a is then debarked from l1 back to l0.
