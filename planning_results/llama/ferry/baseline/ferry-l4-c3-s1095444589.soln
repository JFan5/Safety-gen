The problem is to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the goal of moving a car from one location to another, while satisfying the constraints and preconditions defined in the domain.

Here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l1)
(debark c0 l0)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(debark c1 l0)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c2 l3)
(debark c2 l0)
