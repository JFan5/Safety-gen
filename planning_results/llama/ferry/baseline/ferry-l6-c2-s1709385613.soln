Based on the provided domain and problem, the plan can be generated as follows:

1. sail l0 l1
2. sail l1 l2
3. sail l2 l3
4. sail l3 l4
5. sail l4 l5
6. board c0 l2
7. board c1 l3
8. debark c0 l2
9. debark c1 l3

This plan satisfies all the preconditions and effects of the actions, and it also satisfies the goal of reaching l2 and l3 with the cars c0 and c1, respectively.
