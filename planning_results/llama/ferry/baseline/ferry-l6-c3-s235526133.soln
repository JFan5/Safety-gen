To generate a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given input, we need to follow the planning rules provided.

First, we need to check if the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints. In this case, the initial state does not satisfy all goals, so we need to generate a plan.

Here is the plan:

(sail l0 l1)
(board c0 l2)
(sail l1 l3)
(board c1 l4)
(sail l4 l5)
(debark c2 l2)

This plan satisfies all goals and constraints.
