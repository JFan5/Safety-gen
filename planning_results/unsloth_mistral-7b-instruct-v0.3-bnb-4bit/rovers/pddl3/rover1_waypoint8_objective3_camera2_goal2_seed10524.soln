Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective2 camera0 colour)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 low_res waypoint6 waypoint1)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover is initially at waypoint4. The plan collects soil samples from waypoint1, communicates the data to the lander at waypoint0, moves to the rock sample location at waypoint5, takes an image of the rock sample using the high-resolution camera, drops the store, and finally communicates the image data to the lander at waypoint1 using the low-resolution camera.
