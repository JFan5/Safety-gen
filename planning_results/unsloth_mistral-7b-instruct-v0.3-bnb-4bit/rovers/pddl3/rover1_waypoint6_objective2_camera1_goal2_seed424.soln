Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective0 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective1 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between all waypoints, and that the lander is initially at waypoint5. The plan collects soil and rock samples, communicates the soil data to the lander, moves the rover to different locations, takes images of the objectives with the camera, and communicates the images to the lander.
