Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0 rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint2 rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective2 camera1 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 high_res waypoint1 rover0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the samples can be communicated to the lander as soon as they are taken. The plan also assumes that the rover is initially equipped for rock analysis and imaging, and that the camera is calibrated for high-resolution imaging. The plan ensures that the rock data from waypoints 2 and 3, and the image data from objective 2 in high-resolution mode, are communicated to the lander.
