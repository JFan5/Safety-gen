Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(equip_for_rock_analysis rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(equip_for_imaging rover0)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 camera0 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res waypoint0 waypoint2 waypoint5)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that it has the necessary equipment for sampling soil, rocks, and taking images. The plan aims to communicate soil data from waypoints 1 and 4, rock data from waypoint 2, and an image from objective 0 using the low-res mode to the lander (general). The plan also drops the store (rover0store) after using it to store soil and rock samples.
