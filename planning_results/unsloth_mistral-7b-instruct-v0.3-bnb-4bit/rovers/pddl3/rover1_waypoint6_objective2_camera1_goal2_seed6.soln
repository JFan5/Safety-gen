Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0 waypoint3)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 objective0 high_res camera0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 high_res camera0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint5 waypoint4)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is available and the channel is free when needed for communication. The plan also assumes that the rover is initially equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging, and that the camera is calibrated for high-res mode. The plan collects soil and rock samples, communicates the data to the lander, calibrates the camera for the objective, takes images, and communicates the image data to the lander.
