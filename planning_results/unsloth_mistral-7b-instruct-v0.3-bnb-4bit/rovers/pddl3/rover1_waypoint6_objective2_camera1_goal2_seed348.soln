Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given situation:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(drop rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0 general)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 objective0 camera0 colour)
(drop camera0 general)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective1 camera0 high_res)
(drop camera0 general)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints, that it has the necessary equipment for sampling soil and rocks, and that the camera is calibrated and can support both color and high-resolution modes. The plan also assumes that the lander is available and the channel is free when needed for communication. The plan collects rock samples from waypoints 0, 1, and 2, takes soil samples at waypoint 2, calibrates the camera at waypoint 3, takes images at waypoints 3 and 4, and communicates the rock data for waypoint 2 and the images for objectives 0 and 1 to the lander.
