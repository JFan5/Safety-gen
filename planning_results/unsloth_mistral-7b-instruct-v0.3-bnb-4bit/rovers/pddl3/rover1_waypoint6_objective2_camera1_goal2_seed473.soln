Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint2 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint0 rover0store)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 camera0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 colour waypoint5 waypoint0)
```

This plan achieves the goal conditions and satisfies the hard constraint specified in the problem. It uses only the available symbols and respects the typing. The plan is sequential and grounded.
