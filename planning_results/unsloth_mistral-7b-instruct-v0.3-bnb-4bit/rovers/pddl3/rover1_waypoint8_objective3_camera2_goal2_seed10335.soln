Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective2 low_res)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective2 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover is initially equipped for soil analysis and imaging. The plan collects soil samples from waypoint3, communicates the data to the lander at waypoint4, moves to waypoint2, drops the store, moves to waypoint1, collects a rock sample, communicates the data to the lander at waypoint2, moves back to waypoint0, and takes images of waypoint0 in both low-res and high-res modes.
