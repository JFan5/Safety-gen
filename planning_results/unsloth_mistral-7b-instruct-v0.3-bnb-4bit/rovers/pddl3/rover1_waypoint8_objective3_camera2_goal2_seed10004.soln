Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal conditions:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint3 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint4 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(drop rover0store waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective1 low_res camera0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the initial state satisfies all preconditions for the actions in the plan. The plan achieves the goal conditions by first navigating the rover to each waypoint, sampling soil and rock at relevant locations, dropping the collected samples, calibrating the camera, taking images, and finally communicating the data back to the lander.
