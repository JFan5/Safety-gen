Based on the provided instructions and the given domain and problem, the plan to achieve the goal is as follows:

```
(sail l2 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(board c2 l2)
(debark c1 l2)
(debark c2 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
```

This plan will move the cars from their initial locations to the final destination, following the constraints specified in the problem. The plan respects the domain, uses only available symbols, and satisfies the given constraints.
