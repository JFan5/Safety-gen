Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(sail l1 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(sail l2 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
```

This plan moves the cars from their initial locations to the desired locations while satisfying the given constraints. The plan starts by sailing the ferry from location l1 to l2, then boards the cars c0 and c1 onto the ferry at location l2. After that, the ferry sails back to location l1, and the cars are debarked at their final destinations.
