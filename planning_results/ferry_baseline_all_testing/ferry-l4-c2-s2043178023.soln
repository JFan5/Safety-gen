Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here is the plan:

```
(sail l0 l2)
(sail l2 l3)
(board c0 l3)
(board c1 l3)
(sail l3 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l0)
```

This plan moves the ferry from `l0` to `l2`, then to `l3`, boards the cars `c0` and `c1` onto the ferry at `l3`, and finally sails the ferry to `l1`, debarking the cars at their respective destinations. This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals specified in the problem.
