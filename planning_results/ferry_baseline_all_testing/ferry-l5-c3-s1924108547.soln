Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l4 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l1)
(sail l1 l0)
(debark c1 l0)
(debark c2 l0)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location l4 to l1, boards cars c1 and c2 onto the ferry at location l1, then moves the ferry from location l1 to l0, and finally debarks cars c1 and c2 at location l0. This plan satisfies all the preconditions of each action, respects the domain and problem constraints, and achieves the goal of having cars c0, c1, and c2 at their respective locations.
