Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l1 l4)
(board c0 l4)
(board c1 l4)
(sail l4 l1)
(debark c0 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l4)
```

This plan moves the cars from location `l1` to the ferry at location `l4`, boards them onto the ferry, sails the ferry to location `l1`, debarks the cars, and then sails the ferry back to location `l4`. This plan satisfies all the preconditions of the actions, respects the domain and problem, and satisfies the constraints provided in the problem.
