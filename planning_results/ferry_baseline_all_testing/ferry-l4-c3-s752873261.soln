Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l1 l3)
(board c1 l3)
(sail l3 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(debark c1 l1)
(sail l1 l2)
(debark c2 l0)
(debark c1 l1)
```

This plan moves the cars from their initial locations to the final ones, respecting the constraints specified in the problem. The plan assumes that the ferry moves from one location to another as specified in the `sail` action. The cars board and debark from the ferry as specified in the `board` and `debark` actions.
