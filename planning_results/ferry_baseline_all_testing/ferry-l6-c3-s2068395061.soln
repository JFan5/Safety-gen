Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l4 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l4)
(debark c0 l4)
(debark c1 l4)
(debark c2 l4)
(sail l4 l2)
(board c0 l2)
(board c1 l3)
(board c2 l5)
```

This plan assumes that the initial state already satisfies all goals and constraints (if any). If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), the output would be `(NO-PLAN)`.
