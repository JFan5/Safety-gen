Based on the provided problem and domain, the plan to achieve the goal is as follows:

```
(sail l2 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(sail l0 l1)
(board c1 l1)
(sail l1 l4)
(board c2 l4)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location `l2` to `l0`, boards car `c0` at `l0`, moves the ferry from `l0` to `l1`, boards car `c1` at `l1`, and finally moves the ferry from `l1` to `l4`, where car `c2` debarks. This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals as defined in the problem.
