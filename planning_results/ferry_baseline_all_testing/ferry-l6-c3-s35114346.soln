Based on the provided domain and problem, here is the plan for the given problem:

```
(sail l1 l3)
(board c0 l3)
(sail l3 l4)
(board c0 l4)
(sail l0 l2)
(board c1 l2)
(sail l2 l1)
(board c2 l1)
```

This plan will move the cars from their initial locations to their goal locations using the `sail` and `board` actions. The `sail` action changes the location of the ferry, while the `board` action moves the cars onto the ferry and vice versa.
