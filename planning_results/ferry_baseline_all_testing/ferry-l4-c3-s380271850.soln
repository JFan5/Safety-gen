Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l3 l0)
(board c0 l0)
(board c1 l0)
(board c2 l0)
(sail l0 l3)
(debark c0 l3)
(debark c1 l3)
(debark c2 l3)
```

This plan moves the ferry from location l3 to l0, boards the cars c0, c1, and c2 onto the ferry at location l0, and then moves the ferry back to location l3, debarking the cars at their respective destinations.
