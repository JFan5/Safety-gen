The initial state already satisfies all goals:
- (at ball1 room3) → true
- (at ball2 room1) → true
Additionally, the constraint:
(always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))))
is satisfied because robot1 is not carrying any object with lgripper1 — it is only free and not performing any pick/drop actions.
Therefore, no actions are needed.
Output: nothing.
