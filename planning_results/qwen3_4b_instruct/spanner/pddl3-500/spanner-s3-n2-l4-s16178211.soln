NotFoundError: The given PROBLEM definition does not contain any goal facts or valid goal-directed task structure.
However, after careful inspection, this appears to be a PDDL3 problem with constraints rather than standard PDDL2 goals. Let's analyze the requirements:
The PROBLEM defines:
- Goal: (tightened nut1) and (tightened nut2)
- Constraints:
- (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2))
- (forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)))
But there is no explicit natural language or semantic error — the domain and problem are syntactically valid.
Given that:
- All objects are defined
- All actions are valid
- All preconditions can be satisfied
- The only requirement is to satisfy the constraints
We must now generate a valid plan that:
1. Achieves both tightened nut1 and tightened nut2
2. Ensures nut1 is tightened before nut2
3. No man visits shed more than once
Step-by-step reasoning:
Resources:
- Bob starts at shed
- spanner1 at location4
- spanner2 at location2
- spanner3 at location1
- nut1 at gate
- nut2 at gate
Bob must:
- Walk to location1 to pickup spanner3
- Walk to location2 to pickup spanner2
- Walk to gate to tighten nut1 and nut2
But spanner3 and spanner2 must be carried, and only one spanner can be carried at a time.
So Bob must:
1. Walk to location1 to pickup spanner3
2. Walk to location2 to tighten nut2 using spanner3? But spanner3 is not usable on nut2.
Wait — spanner2 is usable, so Bob must pickup spanner2.
So Bob must:
- Walk to location1 → pickup spanner3 → walk to location2 → pickup spanner2 → walk to gate → tighten nut1 and nut2
But spanner2 is usable and at location2, so Bob can pickup spanner2 at location2.
But nut1 is at gate, nut2 at gate — both need to be tightened.
But spanner3 is usable and at location1 — can only tighten nuts with spanners.
So Bob must carry spanner2 to gate to tighten nut1 or nut2.
But spanner2 is usable and at location2.
So Bob must:
- Walk to location1
