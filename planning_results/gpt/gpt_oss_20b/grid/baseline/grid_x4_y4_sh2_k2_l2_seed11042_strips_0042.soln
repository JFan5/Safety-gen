analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that moves key1 from pos0-2 to pos1-3. The robot starts at pos3-1. The robot must avoid being at pos2-1 due to constraint: always (not (at-robot pos2-1)). So robot cannot be at pos2-1 at any time. Also robot must pick up key1 at pos0-2, then move to pos1-3, then put down key1 at pos1-3. But need to ensure that at each step, the robot is not at pos2-1. Also need to ensure that the robot can move through open positions. All positions are open except pos3-0 and pos3-3 locked. But robot cannot be at pos3-0 or pos3-3 because locked? Actually locked means cannot be at? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions if open? Wait locked means locked, but open means open. The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions if it's locked? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions? The robot can be at locked positions?
