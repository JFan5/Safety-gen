analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that moves keys to goal positions. Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-3)). So robot cannot be at pos1-3 at any time. Also initial robot at pos1-2. Locked positions: pos5-0, pos3-1, pos4-2. They are locked initially. We need to get key0 to pos4-1 and key1 to pos2-2. Key2 is irrelevant.
We need to plan moves. We need to consider unlocking locks to access positions? The goal positions are open except locked ones. Let's see open status: open pos4-1? It's not listed as open. We have open pos4-1? In init, open pos4-1 is not listed. Wait open pos4-1 is not in the list. open pos4-1 is not listed. So pos4-1 is locked initially? Actually locked pos4-2 is locked. pos4-1 is not locked. But open pos4-1 is not listed, so it's not open. But open pos4-1 is not in the list, so it's not open. But we need to get key0 to pos4-1. So we need to unlock pos4-1? But there's no lock-shape for pos4-1. So maybe it's open by default? Wait open pos4-1 is not listed, but open pos4-1 is not in the init. So it's not open. But maybe it's open by default? The init lists open for many positions but not all. Let's check: open pos4-1 is not listed. So it's not open. But we need to get key0 to pos4-1. We can move robot to pos4-1 if it's open. But it's not open. So we need to unlock it? But there's no lock-shape for pos4-1. So maybe it's open by default? Actually open predicate indicates open status. If not listed, it's false. So pos4-1 is not open. But we can still move robot to pos4-1 if it's open? The move action requires open nextpos. So we cannot move to pos4-1 unless it's open. So we need to unlock pos4-1? But there's no lock-shape. So maybe it's open by default? Wait open pos4-1 is
