analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to move key1 from pos4-4 to pos1-2. The robot starts at pos4-1. The robot can move along connections, but cannot be at pos3-4 due to constraint. Also, key1 is at pos4-4 initially. We need to pick up key1 and move to pos1-2. But we must consider locked positions: pos2-0, pos1-3, pos4-2 are locked. We can unlock them by unlocking with appropriate key shape. But we don't need to unlock them if we don't need to pass through them. We need to find a path from pos4-1 to pos1-2 that doesn't go through locked positions or through pos3-4. Let's examine connections.
We have connections list. Let's map grid positions: 5x5 grid positions pos0-0 to pos4-4. Connections are given for each pair. We need to find a path from pos4-1 to pos1-2.
We need to consider open positions: open pos0-0 to pos4-4 except pos4-2 is locked? Wait open list includes open pos4-3, pos4-4, but not open pos4-2. Actually open list includes open pos4-3 and pos4-4 but not open pos4-2. But open pos4-2 is not listed. So pos4-2 is locked. So we cannot go through pos4-2. But we can go through other positions.
We need to avoid pos3-4 due to constraint. So we cannot be at pos3-4 at any time.
We need to pick up key1 at pos4-4. The robot is at pos4-1. So we need to move to pos4-4, pick up key1, then move to pos1-2, and put down key1.
We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: robot cannot be at pos3-4 at any time. So we must avoid that position.
We also need to ensure that we don't violate locked positions: we cannot enter locked positions unless unlocked. But we can pass through open positions. Let's check locked positions: pos2-0, pos1-3, pos4-2. So we cannot go through those unless we unlock them. But we don't need to go through them.
We need to find a path from pos4-1 to pos4-4. Let's
