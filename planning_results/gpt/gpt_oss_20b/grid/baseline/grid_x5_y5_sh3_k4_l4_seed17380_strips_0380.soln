analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Goal: keys at specific positions: key0 at pos1-4, key1 at pos1-2, key2 at pos2-1, key3 at pos3-2.
Initial positions: key0 at pos3-1, key1 at pos0-1, key2 at pos1-0, key3 at pos4-2. Robot at pos1-3. All positions open except locked ones: pos0-2, pos3-3, pos1-1, pos2-4. Those are locked. But open status: open pos0-0, pos0-1, pos0-3, pos0-4, pos1-0, pos1-2, pos1-3, pos1-4, pos2-0, pos2-1, pos2-2, pos2-3, pos3-0, pos3-1, pos3-2, pos3-4, pos4-0, pos4-1, pos4-2, pos4-3, pos4-4. Wait open pos3-2? Yes open pos3-2. So all open except locked ones. But open status indicates that locked positions are not open? Actually open predicate indicates open. But locked positions are locked. But open pos0-2? Not listed. So locked positions are not open. So robot cannot move into locked positions unless unlocked.
Robot starts at pos1-3. We need to move keys to goal positions.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-1)). So robot cannot be at pos1-1 at any time.
We need to plan sequence of actions: move robot, pick up keys, move keys, put down.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to consider that keys can be moved by picking up and putting down. The robot can carry one key at a time (holding). The robot can pick up a key if at same position and arm-empty. After picking up, arm-empty becomes false, holding becomes true.
We need to move keys
