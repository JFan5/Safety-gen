analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos2-0. Keys: key0 at pos2-1, key1 at pos0-3. Locked positions: pos3-0 and pos3-1. lock-shape pos3-0 shape0, pos3-1 shape1. Goal: key0 at pos1-0, key1 at pos3-3.
We need to move keys to goal positions. We must consider locked positions: pos3-0 and pos3-1 are locked. They have shapes shape0 and shape1 respectively. To unlock them, we need to use the appropriate key with matching shape. key0 shape0, key1 shape1. So to unlock pos3-0, we need key0; to unlock pos3-1, we need key1.
But goal requires key1 at pos3-3, which is open. So we don't need to unlock pos3-1? Wait, key1 must end at pos3-3, which is open. So we don't need to unlock pos3-1. But we might need to unlock pos3-0 to get to pos3-3? Actually pos3-3 is open, so we can move robot to pos3-3 directly. But to get key0 to pos1-0, we need to move key0 from pos2-1 to pos1-0. That path may involve locked positions? Let's examine connectivity.
Positions: 4x4 grid positions pos0-0 to pos3-3. Connections given. Let's map connectivity.
Connections:
- pos0-0 connected to pos1-0 and pos0-1.
- pos0-1 connected to pos1-1, pos0-2, pos0-0.
- pos0-2 connected to pos1-2, pos0-3, pos0-1.
- pos0-3 connected to pos1-3, pos0-2.
- pos1-0 connected to pos2-0, pos1-1, pos0-0.
- pos1-1 connected to pos2-1, pos1-2
