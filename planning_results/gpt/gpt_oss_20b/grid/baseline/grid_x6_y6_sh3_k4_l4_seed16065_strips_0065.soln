analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to achieve goal: (at key1 pos2-1). Initially key1 at pos0-3. We need to move robot to pick up key1 and bring to pos2-1. But there are locked positions: pos5-5, pos3-3, pos5-4, pos4-4 locked. But we don't need to go there. We need to navigate robot from pos1-4 to pos2-1. But we must obey constraint: always (not (at-robot pos1-3)). So robot cannot be at pos1-3 at any time. So we must avoid that.
We need to pick up key1 at pos0-3. But key1 is at pos0-3. Wait key1 at pos0-3. But key0 also at pos0-3? Actually both key0 and key1 at pos0-3. That seems weird: two keys at same location. But okay.
We need to pick up key1. But we have two keys at same location. We can pick up key1. But we need to ensure we don't pick up key0 inadvertently. But we can pick up key1.
We need to move robot to pos0-3 from pos1-4. Let's see connections: pos1-4 connected to pos2-4, pos1-3, pos0-4. So robot at pos1-4 can move to pos1-3, pos2-4, pos0-4. But constraint forbids at pos1-3. So we can move to pos2-4 or pos0-4. Let's choose pos2-4. Then from pos2-4 to pos2-3? Wait connections: pos2-4 connected to pos3-4, pos2-5, pos1-4, pos2-3. So we can go to pos2-3. Then to pos2-2, pos2-1. But we need to get to pos2-1 eventually. But we need to pick up key1 at pos0-3. So we need to go from pos1-4 to pos0-3. Let's find path: pos1-4 -> pos0-4 -> pos0-3. But pos0-4 connected to pos0-3. So path: pos1-4 to pos0-4 to pos0-3. But we need to ensure we don't go through
