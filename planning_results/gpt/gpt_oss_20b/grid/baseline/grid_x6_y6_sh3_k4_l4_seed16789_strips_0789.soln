analysisWe need to produce a plan that moves keys to target positions. We have a grid 6x6. The robot starts at pos1-3. Keys: key0 at pos5-3, key1 at pos3-1, key2 at pos2-0, key3 at pos5-1. Goal: key1 at pos4-3, key2 at pos4-5, key3 at pos3-5. Also constraints: never at pos4-1. Also we have locked positions: pos0-3, pos4-2, pos3-3, pos3-0. Those are locked initially. We need to unlock them by unlocking actions. Unlock action requires at-robot at curpos, at lockpos, holding key, key-shape matches shape, lock-shape matches shape, locked, etc. So to unlock a lock, we need to have a key of matching shape. For key1 shape1, key2 shape2, key3 shape2. lock-shape: pos0-3 shape0, pos4-2 shape1, pos3-3 shape2, pos3-0 shape0. So only lock shape1 is pos4-2. So to unlock pos4-2 we need key of shape1. But key1 shape1 is at pos3-1 initially. So we need to bring key1 to pos4-2? Wait goal doesn't require key1 at pos4-2. But we need to unlock pos4-2 to allow robot to pass through? Actually robot can move through open positions only. Locked positions cannot be entered unless unlocked. So to reach goal positions, we may need to unlock some locked positions. Let's analyze path.
Goal positions: key1 at pos4-3, key2 at pos4-5, key3 at pos3-5. These positions are open? Let's check open status: open pos4-3? Not listed. open pos4-3 is not in open list. So pos4-3 is locked initially. We need to unlock it. But lock-shape for pos4-3? Not specified. So maybe it's not locked. Wait open list includes open pos4-3? It includes open pos4-3? It lists open pos4-3? Actually open list includes open pos4-3? It lists open pos4-3? It lists open pos4-3? It lists open pos4-3? Let's check: open pos
