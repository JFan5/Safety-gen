analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos1-0. Keys: key0 at pos4-2, key1 at pos4-2, key2 at pos2-0, key3 at pos2-4. Locked positions: pos5-2, pos3-1, pos2-5, pos0-0. Open positions: many open except some locked ones. The goal: key2 at pos1-5, key3 at pos5-2.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos2-3)). So robot cannot be at pos2-3 at any time.
We need to plan to move key2 from pos2-0 to pos1-5, and key3 from pos2-4 to pos5-2. But pos5-2 is locked initially. So we need to unlock pos5-2 using a key of shape matching lock-shape. lock-shape pos5-2 shape0. So we need a key with shape0. Which keys have shape0? key0 shape0, key3 shape0. key0 at pos4-2, key3 at pos2-4. So we can use key0 to unlock pos5-2. But key0 is at pos4-2. We need to get key0 to pos5-2? Wait unlocking requires holding a key with shape matching lock-shape. The unlock action requires parameters: ?curpos ?lockpos ?key ?shape. Preconditions: place ?curpos, place ?lockpos, key ?key, shape ?shape, conn ?curpos ?lockpos, key-shape ?key ?shape, lock-shape ?lockpos ?shape, at-robot ?curpos, locked ?lockpos, holding ?key. So robot must be at ?curpos, lockpos must be adjacent, key must be held, shape matches lock-shape. So to unlock pos5-2, robot must be at a position adjacent to pos5-2, holding a key with shape0. So we need to get key0 to robot, then move to adjacent to pos5-2, then unlock
