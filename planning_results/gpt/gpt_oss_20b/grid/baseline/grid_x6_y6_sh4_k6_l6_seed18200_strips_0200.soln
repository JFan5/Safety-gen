analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to find a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: key0 at pos5-3, key1 at pos1-2, key3 at pos0-5, key4 at pos2-4. Initially keys at positions: key0 pos0-1, key1 pos1-0, key2 pos2-4, key3 pos0-2, key4 pos3-0, key5 pos5-3. Also robot at pos0-0. Locked positions: pos3-3, pos4-5, pos3-1, pos1-5, pos1-3, pos2-2. Constraint: never at pos2-2. So robot cannot be at pos2-2. Also locked positions cannot be entered unless unlocked. But open positions are open except locked ones. We need to move keys to goal positions. We can pick up keys, move robot, put down. We need to ensure we don't go to locked positions. Also we need to unlock locked positions if needed to move keys? But goal positions are open: pos5-3 is open? pos5-3 is open. pos1-2 is open. pos0-5 is open. pos2-4 is open. So we don't need to unlock any locked positions. But we need to move keys to those positions. We need to pick up keys and move them.
We need to consider that keys can be moved by robot. The robot can pick up a key at its current position if at-robot at that position and key at that position. Then robot can move to adjacent open positions. The robot cannot be at pos2-2 due to constraint. So we must avoid that.
We need to plan a sequence of actions: pickup, move, putdown. We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to output plan lines: action name and parameters.
We need to use only objects defined: positions, keys, shapes, etc.
We need to ensure that at each step, the robot's location and key positions are consistent.
We need to consider that the robot starts at pos0-0. It can move to adjacent positions: pos1-0, pos0-1. But pos0-1 is open. pos1-0 is open. But pos1-0 has key1. So we can pick up key1 at pos1-0. But we need
