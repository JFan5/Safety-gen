analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Goal: at key0 pos0-1, key1 pos0-2, key2 pos0-3.
Initial state: robot at pos2-0. Keys at pos2-1, pos4-2, pos4-4. Locks at pos4-1, pos3-1, pos3-4. These locks are locked initially. lock-shape: pos4-1 shape0, pos3-1 shape1, pos3-4 shape0. So to unlock, need key with matching shape and at lock position, robot at current position, holding key, etc.
We need to move robot to positions to pick up keys and move them to goal positions. Also need to unlock locks if needed to pass through locked positions? The robot can move only to open positions. The locked positions are locked initially, but open? Wait open predicate indicates open status. For locked positions, open is false? In init, open pos4-1? Not listed. open pos4-1 not listed. So locked pos4-1, pos3-1, pos3-4. So robot cannot move into those positions unless unlocked. But the goal positions are pos0-1, pos0-2, pos0-3, all open. So we need to get keys to those positions.
We need to pick up key0 at pos2-1, key1 at pos4-2, key2 at pos4-4. Then move them to goal positions.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-3)). So robot cannot be at pos3-3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that respects that.
We need to consider connectivity: we have connections between positions. We need to navigate robot from pos2-0 to pos2-1 to pick up key0. Then move to pos0-1 to put down key0. Then pick up key1 at pos4-2, move to pos0-2, etc. But we need to consider locked positions: pos4-1, pos3-1, pos3-4 are locked. Are
