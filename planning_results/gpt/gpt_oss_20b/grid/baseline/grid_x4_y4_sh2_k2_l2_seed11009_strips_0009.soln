analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Goal: (at key1 pos1-1). Initially key1 at pos0-2. Robot at pos1-2. We need to move key1 to pos1-1.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos0-1)). So robot cannot be at pos0-1 at any time.
We need to plan a sequence of actions that moves key1 to pos1-1.
We have to consider that key1 is at pos0-2 initially. We can pick it up, move robot to pos1-1, put it down. But we must ensure robot never at pos0-1. So we must avoid moving to pos0-1.
Check connectivity: pos0-2 connects to pos0-1, pos0-3, pos1-2. So robot at pos1-2 initially. To get to pos1-1, robot can move from pos1-2 to pos1-1 directly (conn pos1-2 pos1-1). That is allowed. But we need to pick up key1 at pos0-2. Robot at pos1-2 cannot pick up key1 because key1 is at pos0-2. So robot must move to pos0-2 first. But pos0-2 connects to pos1-2, pos0-3, pos0-1. Robot at pos1-2 can move to pos0-2 via conn pos1-2 pos0-2. That is allowed. But we must ensure robot never at pos0-1. So we can avoid that.
Sequence: robot at pos1-2. Move to pos0-2. Pick up key1. Move to pos1-1. Put down key1. That satisfies goal.
Check constraints: robot cannot be at pos0-1. We never go there. Good.
Check preconditions for actions:
- move: precondition requires at-robot at curpos, conn curpos nextpos, open nextpos. All open except pos0-3 and pos3-3 are locked initially. But we don't need to go there.
- pickup:
