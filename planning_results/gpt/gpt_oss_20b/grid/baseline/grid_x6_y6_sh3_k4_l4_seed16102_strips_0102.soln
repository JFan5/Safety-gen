analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: key0 at pos1-3 and key3 at pos2-1. Initially key0 at pos1-4, key3 at pos4-5. Robot at pos5-1. Need to move robot to pick up key0, move to pos1-3, put down. Also need to get key3 to pos2-1. We have locked positions: pos0-1, pos3-4, pos0-2, pos3-2. But those are locked; but open status: open pos0-0, pos0-3, pos0-4, pos0-5, etc. Locked positions are not open. But we need to move robot to pos2-1; pos2-1 is open. So robot can move.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos4-4)). So robot cannot be at pos4-4 at any time. So avoid that.
We need to plan actions: pickup key0 at pos1-4, move to pos1-3, putdown. For key3: need to get to pos2-1. Key3 at pos4-5. Robot at pos5-1. Need to move to pos4-5, pick up key3, move to pos2-1, putdown.
We must ensure robot never at pos4-4. So avoid moving to that.
We need to consider connectivity: connections list includes many. Let's check connectivity: pos4-5 connected to pos5-5 and pos4-4. But pos4-4 is locked? Actually pos4-4 is open. But robot cannot be at pos4-4. So we can avoid that.
We need to plan path from pos5-1 to pos4-5: connections: pos5-1 connected to pos5-2, pos4-1, pos5-0. pos4-1 connected to pos5-1, pos4-2, pos3-1. pos4-2 connected to pos5-2, pos4-3, pos3-2. pos4-3 connected to pos5-3, pos4-4, pos3-3. pos4-4 connected to pos5-4, pos4-5, pos3-4. pos4-5 connected to pos5-5, pos3-5, pos4-4. So path:
