analysisWe need to produce a plan that moves robot from pos3-0 to goal: key1 at pos0-1, key2 at pos1-4. Initially key1 at pos0-4, key2 at pos2-1. Robot at pos3-0. Need to pick up key1 and move to pos0-1, and key2 to pos1-4. Also constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-1)). So robot cannot be at pos1-1 at any time. Also locked positions: pos1-3, pos2-4, pos3-2 are locked initially. We can unlock them by unlocking action. But we need to unlock pos1-3? Not necessary maybe. But to move to pos1-4, we need to get to pos1-4. Path: from pos3-0 to pos2-0 to pos1-0 to pos1-1? Wait cannot be at pos1-1. So we need to go around. Let's map grid: 5x5 positions. Robot starts at pos3-0. We need to get to pos0-1 to pick key1. Path: pos3-0 -> pos2-0 -> pos1-0 -> pos0-0 -> pos0-1. But pos1-0 is open. pos0-0 open. So path is fine. But we must avoid pos1-1. So we can go pos3-0 -> pos2-0 -> pos1-0 -> pos0-0 -> pos0-1. That works. Then pick up key1 at pos0-1. Then need to move to pos1-4 to drop key2. But key2 is at pos2-1. We need to pick up key2 and move to pos1-4. Path: from pos0-1 to pos1-1? But cannot be at pos1-1. So we need to go around: pos0-1 -> pos0-2 -> pos1-2 -> pos1-3? But pos1-3 is locked. We can unlock it. But we might avoid by going to pos0-2 -> pos1-2 -> pos1-3? But we can't be at pos1-1. So we can go pos0-1 -> pos0-2 -> pos1-2 -> pos1-3? But pos1-3 locked. We can unlock it by
