analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos3-3. Keys at positions: key0 at pos2-3, key1 at pos0-1, key2 at pos4-4. Locked positions: pos0-4, pos4-0, pos2-2. lock-shape: pos0-4 shape0, pos4-0 shape1, pos2-2 shape1. open positions: all except locked ones? open pos0-0 etc. So locked positions are not open.
Goal: key0 at pos4-2, key1 at pos3-3. So we need to move key0 to pos4-2, key1 to pos3-3. Also constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-2)). So robot cannot be at pos3-2 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that keys can be moved by picking up and putting down. The robot can move between positions via move action, but only to open positions. The robot cannot be at pos3-2 at any time. So we must avoid moving to pos3-2.
Also, we have locked positions: pos0-4, pos4-0, pos2-2. These are locked, cannot be entered? The open predicate indicates open positions. The robot can only move to open positions. So locked positions are not open. So robot cannot go to pos0-4, pos4-0, pos2-2. But we might need to unlock them? The unlock action requires at-robot at curpos, locked at lockpos, holding key, etc. But we cannot unlock locked positions because they are locked. But we might need to unlock them to move keys? Let's see.
Goal: key0 at pos4-2. pos4-2 is open (open pos4-2). So we can move key0 there. key1 at pos3-3. pos3-3 is open. So we need to move keys accordingly.
We need to plan robot moves to pick up keys and put them down at target positions.
