analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos0-3. At key0 pos2-1, key1 pos2-1. Wait both keys at same location? Actually both keys at pos2-1. That seems odd but okay.
Goal: at key0 pos2-0. So we need to move key0 to pos2-0.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-1)). So robot cannot be at pos1-1 at any time.
We need to plan a sequence of actions to move key0 from pos2-1 to pos2-0.
We can pick up key0 at pos2-1, move robot to pos2-0, put down key0 at pos2-0.
But we must ensure robot never at pos1-1. So we must avoid moving robot to pos1-1.
Check connectivity: pos2-1 connects to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1, pos2-0. So robot can move from pos2-1 to pos2-0 directly via conn pos2-1 pos2-0. That is allowed. But we must ensure robot not at pos1-1. So we can move robot from pos0-3 to pos1-3 to pos2-3 to pos2-2 to pos2-1 to pos2-0. But we need to check connectivity: pos0-3 connects to pos1-3, pos0-2. pos1-3 connects to pos2-3, pos0-3, pos1-2. pos2-3 connects to pos3-3, pos1-3, pos2-2. pos2-2 connects to pos3-2, pos2-3, pos1-2, pos2-1. pos2-1 connects to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1, pos2-0. So path exists.
We must ensure robot never at pos1-1. So we can avoid that.
Also we need to consider locked positions: pos2-2 and pos3-0
