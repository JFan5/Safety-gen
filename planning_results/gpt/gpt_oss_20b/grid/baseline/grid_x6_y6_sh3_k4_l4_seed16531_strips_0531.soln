analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to move key3 from pos2-3 to pos2-5. The robot starts at pos5-1. The robot can move along connections. The goal is to have key3 at pos2-5. We must satisfy constraint: never at pos2-4. So robot cannot be at pos2-4 at any time. Also we must ensure key3 ends at pos2-5. We can pick up key3 at pos2-3, move robot to pos2-5, put down key3. But we must ensure robot never at pos2-4. Let's examine connections: pos2-3 connects to pos3-3, pos2-4, pos1-3. Wait connections list: (conn pos2-3 pos3-3), (conn pos2-3 pos2-4), (conn pos2-3 pos1-3), (conn pos2-3 pos2-2). So pos2-3 connects to pos2-4, which is locked. But we can still move there if open? But pos2-4 is locked initially. But we can unlock it using key2? Actually key2 at pos5-1. But we don't need to unlock pos2-4 because we don't need to go there. We just need to go from pos2-3 to pos2-5. Path: pos2-3 -> pos2-4 -> pos2-5. But pos2-4 is locked. We could unlock it using key2 or key3? Wait key3 is shape2. lock-shape pos2-4 shape2. So key3 shape2 can unlock pos2-4. But we need key3 to be at pos2-3 initially. So we cannot use key3 to unlock pos2-4 because we need to move key3 to pos2-5. So we need to unlock pos2-4 using key2 or key0? key2 shape2, key0 shape0, key1 shape1. lock-shape pos2-4 shape2. So only key2 or key3 can unlock pos2-4. But key3 is the key we want to move. So we cannot unlock pos2-4 with key3. We could use key2 to unlock pos2-4. But key2 is at pos5-1. We can move key2 to pos2-4, then unlock pos2-4, then move
