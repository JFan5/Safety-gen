analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to achieve goal: at key2 pos1-0. Initially key2 at pos3-0. Robot at pos3-2. We need to move robot to pos1-0, pick up key2, and place at pos1-0. But constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-1)). So robot cannot be at pos3-1 at any time. Also we must consider locked positions: pos3-3 locked, pos4-0 locked, pos0-1 locked. But open status: open pos3-3? Wait open pos3-3 is open? In init, open pos3-3 is not listed; only open pos3-4, pos3-0, pos3-1, pos3-2, pos3-4. Actually open pos3-3 not listed, so it's closed. But we don't need to unlock pos3-3. We need to move robot from pos3-2 to pos1-0. Path: pos3-2 -> pos2-2 -> pos1-2 -> pos1-1 -> pos1-0. But check connections: pos3-2 connected to pos2-2, pos3-3, pos3-1. pos3-2 to pos2-2 is allowed. pos2-2 connected to pos1-2, pos2-3, pos2-1. So path: pos3-2 -> pos2-2 -> pos1-2 -> pos1-1 -> pos1-0. All open except pos3-3 closed but not used. Need to ensure robot never at pos3-1. Our path doesn't include pos3-1. Good.
We need to pick up key2 at pos3-0. But robot starts at pos3-2. We need to go to pos3-0. Path: pos3-2 -> pos3-1? Wait pos3-2 connected to pos3-1, but that is forbidden. So we cannot go through pos3-1. Alternative: pos3-2 -> pos2-2 -> pos2-1 -> pos1-1 -> pos1-0 -> pos0-0? Wait we need to reach pos3-0. Let's examine connections: pos3-0 connected to pos4-0, pos3-1, pos2-0. pos3-0 is locked? No, open. But to reach
