analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to move key1 from pos3-2 to pos2-0. The robot starts at pos2-1. The robot can move along connections. The goal is to have key1 at pos2-0. We must obey constraint: never at pos3-1. So robot cannot be at pos3-1 at any time. Also we must consider locked positions: pos0-2, pos0-1, pos2-2 are locked. But open positions are all others. The robot can move to open positions. The robot can pick up key1 at pos3-2, then move to pos2-0, then put down. But we must ensure that we don't violate constraints: robot cannot be at pos3-1. So we must avoid that. Also we must ensure that we don't pick up key1 at a locked position? Key1 is at pos3-2, which is open. So we can pick up. The robot is at pos2-1 initially. We need to move to pos3-2. Let's check connections: pos2-1 connected to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1. But pos3-1 is locked? Actually pos3-1 is open. But constraint says robot cannot be at pos3-1. So we cannot go through pos3-1. But we can go from pos2-1 to pos3-2 via pos2-1 to pos3-1? Wait, pos2-1 connected to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1. But pos3-2 is connected to pos2-2, pos3-1, pos3-3. So to get to pos3-2, we might go from pos2-1 to pos2-2? But pos2-2 is locked. So we cannot go there. So we need another path: maybe from pos2-1 to pos1-1 to pos1-2 to pos2-2? But pos2-2 locked. Hmm.
Let's examine connections: pos1-1 connected to pos2-1, pos1-2, pos0-1, pos1-0. So from pos2-1 to pos1-1 is possible. Then from pos1-1 to pos1-2. Then pos1-2 connected to pos2-2, pos1-3, pos0-2, pos1-
