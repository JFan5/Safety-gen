analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos3-1. Keys at positions: key0 at pos0-1, key1 at pos1-1, key2 at pos2-0. Locked positions: pos3-2, pos2-1, pos3-3. lock-shape: pos3-2 shape0, pos2-1 shape1, pos3-3 shape1. open positions: many open except locked ones. open pos2-2, pos2-3, etc. open pos3-4, etc. open pos3-0, pos3-1, pos3-4. open pos4-0 etc. So locked positions are pos3-2, pos2-1, pos3-3. They are locked initially. The goal: key1 at pos0-0, key2 at pos1-1. So we need to move keys to those positions.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-0)). So robot cannot be at pos1-0 at any time. So we must avoid that.
We need to plan a sequence of actions that moves keys to goal positions. We can pick up keys, move robot, put down keys.
We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: robot cannot be at pos1-0 at any time. So we must avoid moving robot to pos1-0. Also we must ensure that we don't violate other constraints: none else.
We need to consider locked positions: pos3-2, pos2-1, pos3-3 are locked. So robot cannot enter those positions unless unlocked. But open positions are open. So robot can move to open positions.
We need to pick up keys and move them to goal positions. Let's analyze connectivity.
We have a grid 5x5 positions pos0-0 to pos4-4. The connections are defined as edges between adjacent positions. The robot starts at pos3-1. We need to get key1 to pos0-0 and key2 to pos1-1.
Key1 is at pos1-1 initially. Key2 at pos2
