analysisWe need to produce a plan that moves keys to goal positions. We have a grid 6x6 positions pos0-0 to pos5-5. The robot starts at pos0-5. Keys: key0 at pos1-3, key1 at pos3-4, key2 at pos5-5, key3 at pos3-2. Goal: key1 at pos0-0, key2 at pos1-3, key3 at pos4-5. Also constraints: always not at-robot pos2-4. So robot cannot be at pos2-4 at any time.
We need to plan actions: pickup, move, putdown, unlock maybe. But keys are at locked positions? Let's check locked positions: locked pos2-5, pos3-5, pos1-2, pos0-2. Those are locked. But keys are at positions that are open? The keys are at pos1-3, pos3-4, pos5-5, pos3-2. Are those positions open? They are open except maybe some locked? Let's check: pos1-3 is open (open pos1-3). pos3-4 is open. pos5-5 is open. pos3-2 is open. So keys are at open positions.
Goal: key1 at pos0-0, key2 at pos1-3, key3 at pos4-5. So we need to move key1 from pos3-4 to pos0-0, key2 from pos5-5 to pos1-3, key3 from pos3-2 to pos4-5. Key0 not in goal.
We need to plan robot movements. The robot can move only to open positions. The robot starts at pos0-5. It cannot be at pos2-4 at any time. So we must avoid that.
We need to pick up keys and put down at goal positions. We can use pickup action: requires at-robot at same position, at key at that position, arm-empty. After pickup, holding key. Then move to goal position, then putdown.
We need to ensure that at-robot is at the key's position, and that the key is at that position. The key is at pos3-4 initially. So robot must go to pos3-4. Let's see connectivity: pos0-5 connects to pos1-5, pos0-4. pos1-5
