analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Goal: (and (at key0 pos0-0) (at key2 pos0-0)). So we need to move key0 and key2 to pos0-0. Initially key0 at pos1-0, key1 at pos1-1, key2 at pos1-3. Robot at pos3-3. Locked positions: pos0-0, pos2-3, pos3-0. Open positions: all except those locked? open pos0-1, pos0-2, pos0-3, pos1-0, pos1-1, pos1-2, pos1-3, pos2-0, pos2-1, pos2-2, pos3-1, pos3-2, pos3-3. So pos0-0 is locked initially. We need to unlock pos0-0. We have key0 shape0, key2 shape0. lock-shape pos0-0 shape0. So key0 can unlock pos0-0. But key0 is at pos1-0. Robot at pos3-3. We need to move robot to pos1-0, pick up key0, then unlock pos0-0, then move to pos0-0, put down key0. Similarly for key2: key2 at pos1-3. We need to get key2 to pos0-0. But pos0-0 is locked until unlocked. We can unlock with key0 or key2. But we need both keys at pos0-0. So we need to unlock pos0-0 first, then move both keys there.
But we must satisfy constraint: always (not (at-robot pos0-2)). So robot cannot be at pos0-2 at any time. So we must avoid moving robot to pos0-2. That's fine.
We need to produce a plan. Let's think of steps.
Initial state: robot at pos3-3. Key0 at pos1-0, key1 at pos1-1, key2 at pos1-3. Locked pos0-0, pos
