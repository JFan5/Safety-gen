analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to move key0 from pos1-3 to pos2-2. The robot starts at pos0-4. The robot can move along connections. The goal is to have key0 at pos2-2. We must satisfy constraint: never at pos1-2. So robot cannot be at pos1-2 at any time. Also key0 initially at pos1-3. We need to pick it up, move to pos2-2, and put down. But we must ensure that robot never at pos1-2. Also we must consider locked positions: pos1-1, pos0-1, pos0-3 are locked. But open status: all open except those locked. The robot can move to open positions. The robot cannot be at pos1-2. So we must avoid that. Let's analyze connectivity.
We have grid positions 0-4 rows and columns. Connections defined. Let's map connectivity quickly.
Connections list:
- pos0-0 connected to pos1-0 and pos0-1
- pos0-1 connected to pos1-1, pos0-2, pos0-0
- pos0-2 connected to pos1-2, pos0-3, pos0-1
- pos0-3 connected to pos1-3, pos0-4, pos0-2
- pos0-4 connected to pos1-4, pos0-3
- pos1-0 connected to pos2-0, pos1-1, pos0-0
- pos1-1 connected to pos2-1, pos1-2, pos0-1, pos1-0
- pos1-2 connected to pos2-2, pos1-3, pos0-2, pos1-1
- pos1-3 connected to pos2-3, pos1-4, pos0-3, pos1-2
- pos1-4 connected to pos2-4, pos0-4, pos1-3
- pos2-0 connected to pos3-0, pos2-1, pos1-0
- pos2-1 connected to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1, pos2-0
- pos2-2 connected to pos3-2, pos2-3, pos1-2, pos2-1
- pos2-3 connected
