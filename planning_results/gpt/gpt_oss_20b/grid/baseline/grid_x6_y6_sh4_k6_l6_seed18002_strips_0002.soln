analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos2-4. Many positions open except some locked positions: pos0-2, pos0-3, pos1-2, pos1-3, pos0-1, pos2-5 are locked. Others open.
Goal:
- key0 at pos2-2
- key1 at pos3-5
- key2 at pos5-5
- key3 at pos3-0
- key5 at pos2-1
Note: key4 not in goal.
We need to move keys to those positions. We have keys at initial positions: key0 at pos5-2, key1 at pos3-4, key2 at pos5-0, key3 at pos5-4, key4 at pos4-2, key5 at pos4-4.
We need to move key0 to pos2-2, key1 to pos3-5, key2 to pos5-5, key3 to pos3-0, key5 to pos2-1.
We also need to ensure robot can move to positions, unlocking locked positions if needed.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos5-3)). So robot cannot be at pos5-3 at any time.
Also, we need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to produce a plan: sequence of actions with parameters.
We need to consider that the robot starts at pos2-4. It can move to adjacent open positions. The grid is 6x6 positions pos0-0 to pos5-5. The connections are given.
We need to move keys to target positions. We can pick up keys, move robot, put down keys.
We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: robot cannot be at pos5-3.
Also, we need to consider locked positions: pos0-2, pos0-3, pos1-2, pos1-3, pos0-1, pos2-5 are locked. So robot cannot enter those positions unless unlocked. But we can unlock them by unlocking action
