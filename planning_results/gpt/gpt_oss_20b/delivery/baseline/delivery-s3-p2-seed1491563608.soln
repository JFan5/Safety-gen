analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_2) (at p2 c_0_2)). So both packages at cell c_0_2.
Initial state: at t1 c_1_2; at p2 c_0_2; at p1 c_2_2; empty t1.
Also adjacency relations: many adjacency pairs.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that moves t1 to c_0_0 at some point, and eventually deliver both packages to c_0_2.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_0_2. Initially p2 is already at c_0_2. So we need to move p1 from c_2_2 to c_0_2.
We need to pick p1, carry it to c_0_2, drop it. But we also need to satisfy constraint that t1 at some point at c_0_0. So we can move t1 to c_0_0 before picking p1.
We also need to ensure that at the end, t1 is somewhere (not specified). But we just need to satisfy constraint.
We need to produce a plan: sequence of actions with parameters.
We must use only objects defined: cells c_0_0 ... c_2_2, packages p1, p2, truck t1.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
Let's analyze adjacency: adjacency pairs given. Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
