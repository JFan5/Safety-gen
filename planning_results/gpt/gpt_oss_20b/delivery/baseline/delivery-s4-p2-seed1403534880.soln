analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_1) (at p2 c_0_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_0_1.
Initial state: p1 at c_3_0, p2 at c_1_1, t1 at c_0_0, empty t1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. Since initial state already has t1 at c_0_0, that constraint is satisfied. But we must ensure that at some point (maybe at start) t1 is at c_0_0. It's already true. So we don't need to keep it.
We need to move t1 to deliver packages to c_0_1. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_0_1.
We need to consider adjacency relations. Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_3_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_3_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c_3_1 c_3_2
- adjacent c_2_3 c_3_3
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_3
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_3_1 c_3_0
- adjacent c_3_2 c_3_3
- adjacent c_1_3 c_0_3
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
