analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at ?x1 - locatable ?x2 - cell; carrying ?t - truck ?p - package; empty ?t - truck; adjacent ?x1 - cell ?x2 - cell; last ?t - truck ?c - cell.
Actions:
pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (and (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t)). Effect: (not (at ?p ?x)), (not (empty ?t)), (carrying ?t ?p).
drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (and (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p)). Effect: (empty ?t), (not (carrying ?t ?p)), (at ?p ?x).
move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: (and (adjacent ?from ?to) (at ?t ?from) (not (= ?from ?to))). Effect: (not (at ?t ?from)), (at ?t ?to), (last ?t ?from).
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_1) (at p2 c_1_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_1.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies goal and constraint.
We have initial positions: p1 at c_2_0, p2 at c_0_0, t1 at c_3_3, empty t1.
We need to move t1 to c_0_0 at some point. Also need to pick up packages and deliver to c_1_1.
We need to consider adjacency list: many adjacent pairs. We need to find path from c_3_3 to c_0_0 via adjacent cells.
Let's list adjacency pairs:
adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
