analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_0) (at p2 c_1_0)). So both packages at cell c_1_0.
Initial state: at p2 c_0_1, at p1 c_2_0, at t1 c_0_2, empty t1. Adjacent relations given.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver both packages to c_1_0. The truck starts at c_0_2. It can move to adjacent cells. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_1_0.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. So we can plan to move to c_0_0 at some point.
We need to pick up p1 at c_2_0, pick up p2 at c_0_1. Then drop both at c_1_0.
We need to consider adjacency: Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_2 c_0_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_
