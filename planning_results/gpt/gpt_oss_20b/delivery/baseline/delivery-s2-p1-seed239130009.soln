analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Problem: cells c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1. Package p1 at c_1_1 initially. Truck t1 at c_1_0 initially. Goal: at p1 c_0_1. Constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). So at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves goal and satisfies constraint.
We need to consider adjacency: adjacency pairs given. Let's list adjacency:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
So adjacency is symmetric for some pairs. Let's map adjacency graph:
c_1_0 adjacent to c_1_1 and c_0_0.
c_1_1 adjacent to c_1_0 and c_0_1.
c_0_1 adjacent to c_1_1 and c_0_0.
c_0_0 adjacent to c_1_0 and c_0_1.
Thus adjacency graph is a square: c_1_0 <-> c_1_1, c_1_0 <-> c_0_0, c_1_1 <-> c_0_1, c_0_1 <-> c_0_0. So it's a cycle of 4 cells.
Goal: package at c_0_1. Initially at c_1_1. Truck at c_1_0. Truck empty.
We need to pick package at c_1_1, then move truck to c_0_1, drop package. But constraint: at some point, truck must be at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0 somewhere.
We need to ensure that at the end, package at c_0_1.
