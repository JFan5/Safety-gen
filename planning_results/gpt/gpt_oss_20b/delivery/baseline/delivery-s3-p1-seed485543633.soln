analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (at p1 c_0_1). Initially: at p1 c_1_0, at t1 c_2_0, empty t1. Adjacent relations given.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver package p1 to c_0_1. Initially at c_1_0. So we need to move truck to c_1_0, pick package, then move to c_0_1, drop.
But we also need to satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where t1 moves to c_0_0. That could be before or after delivering.
We need to ensure that at the end, p1 at c_0_1. Also, we must maintain that at the end, t1 can be anywhere; no requirement.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
Let's examine adjacency: Provided adjacency pairs. Let's list adjacency:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_
