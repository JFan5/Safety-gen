analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_2_2) (at p2 c_2_2))
Initial state: at p2 c_0_3, at t1 c_1_3, at p1 c_2_1, empty t1. Also adjacency relations.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver both packages to c_2_2. The truck t1 starts at c_1_3. It can move to adjacent cells. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_2_2.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. So we must include a move to c_0_0.
We need to plan a sequence of moves and pick/drop actions.
We must also consider adjacency: adjacency relations are given for many pairs. We need to know adjacency graph.
Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_3_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_3_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c_3_1 c_3_2
- adjacent c_2_3 c_3_3
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_3
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_3_1 c_3_0
- adjacent c_3_2 c_3_3
