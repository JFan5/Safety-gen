analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_2) (at p2 c_1_2)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_2.
Initial state: at t1 c_3_2, at p2 c_1_2, at p1 c_0_2, empty t1. So p2 already at c_1_2. Need to move p1 to c_1_2. Also constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). So at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where t1 moves to c_0_0.
We need to plan a sequence of actions that moves t1 from c_3_2 to c_0_0, then pick up p1 at c_0_2, drop it at c_1_2. But we must ensure that at the end, both packages at c_1_2. p2 is already there. So we just need to move p1 to c_1_2.
We need to consider adjacency list. Let's list adjacency pairs:
adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
adjacent c_2
