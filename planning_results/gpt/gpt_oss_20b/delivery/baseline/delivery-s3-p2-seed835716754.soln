analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions: pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_0) (at p2 c_0_0)). So both packages must be at cell c_0_0.
Initial state: at t1 c_1_0; at p2 c_0_2; at p1 c_2_2; empty t1.
Adjacency: many pairs. We need to move truck t1 to pick up packages and deliver them to c_0_0.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to ensure that at some point, t1 is at c_0_0. That is easy: we can move to c_0_0.
Goal: both packages at c_0_0. So we need to pick up each package and drop them at c_0_0.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
Let's examine adjacency graph: cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2.
Adjacency list:
- c_2_0 adjacent to c_2_1 and c_1_0
- c_1_0 adjacent to c_0_0, c_1_1, c_2_0
- c_0_0 adjacent to c_1_0, c_0_1
- c_0_1 adjacent to c_1_1, c_0_0, c_0_2
- c_0_2 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_2
- c_1_1 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_2, c_2_1
- c_1_2 adjacent to c_1_1, c_0_2, c_2_2
- c_2_1 adjacent to c_1_1, c_2_0, c_2_2
