analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at p x, at t x, empty t. Effect: not at p x, not empty t, carrying t p.
drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at t x, carrying t p. Effect: empty t, not carrying t p, at p x.
move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent from to, at t from, not (= from to). Effect: not at t from, at t to, last t from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_3) (at p2 c_1_3)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_3.
Initial state: at t1 c_0_1; at p2 c_2_1; at p1 c_3_3; empty t1. Also adjacency list.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver both packages to c_1_3. The truck starts at c_0_1. It can move to adjacent cells. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_1_3.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0.
We need to plan a sequence of actions.
Let's examine adjacency: adjacency list includes many pairs. Let's list adjacency for each cell:
c_0_0 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_0, c_3_0? Wait adjacency list includes (adjacent c_3_0 c_2_0) etc. Let's parse.
Given adjacency list:
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c
