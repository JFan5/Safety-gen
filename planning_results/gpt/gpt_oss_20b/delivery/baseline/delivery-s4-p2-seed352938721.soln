analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_3_3) (at p2 c_3_3)). So both packages at c_3_3.
Initial state: at t1 c_2_0, at p2 c_3_3, at p1 c_2_1, empty t1.
Also adjacency list: many adjacent pairs. We need to move truck t1 from c_2_0 to somewhere to pick up packages and deliver to c_3_3.
But p2 is already at c_3_3. So we only need to move p1 to c_3_3.
We need to pick p1 at c_2_1, then move truck to c_3_3, then drop p1.
But we must satisfy constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where t1 is at c_0_0 at some time.
Also we must ensure that at the end, both packages at c_3_3. p2 already there, so fine.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider adjacency: we need to know adjacency pairs to move from c_2_0 to c_0_0. Let's examine adjacency list: includes (adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0), (adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0). So path: c_2_0 -> c_1_0 -> c_0_0. So we can move truck from c_2_0 to c_1_0, then to c_0_0. That satisfies constraint.
But we also need to pick up p1 at c_2_1. So we need to move truck to c_2_1, pick up p1, then move to c_3_3, drop.
But we also need to go through c_0_0 at some point. So we can go from c_2_0 to c_1_0 to c_0_0, then back to c_2_1? That seems inefficient but possible
