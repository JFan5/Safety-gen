analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Domain: delivery. We have one truck t1, one package p1. Goal: at p1 c_0_0. Initially at p1 c_2_0, t1 at c_1_0. We have adjacency relations. We need to move truck to pick up package and deliver to c_0_0. Also constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to include that. Also we need to satisfy goal: at p1 c_0_0. So plan: move truck to c_2_0, pick package, move to c_0_0, drop package. But we must ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. That will happen when we drop package at c_0_0. But we need to ensure that at that point, t1 is at c_0_0. Yes, after drop, t1 remains at c_0_0. So constraint satisfied.
We need to ensure adjacency: we have adjacency pairs. Let's list adjacency:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
