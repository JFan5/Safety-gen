analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0.
Goal: (at p1 c_1_1). Initially: p1 at c_0_1, t1 at c_1_1, empty t1.
We need to deliver p1 to c_1_1. Wait, goal is at p1 c_1_1. But initially p1 is at c_0_1. So we need to move p1 to c_1_1. But we also have constraint that at some point t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to plan such that t1 visits c_0_0 at some point.
We need to pick up p1 at its initial location c_0_1, then move truck to deliver to c_1_1. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to plan a route that passes through c_0_0.
Let's examine adjacency: adjacency pairs given:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c
