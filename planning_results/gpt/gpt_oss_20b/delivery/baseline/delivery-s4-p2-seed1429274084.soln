analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_3) (at p2 c_1_3)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_3.
Initial state: at p1 c_0_0, at p2 c_0_0, at t1 c_3_0, empty t1. So truck at c_3_0, empty.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
Goal: both packages at c_1_3. So we need to move truck to c_1_3 carrying each package, drop them.
We need to plan a sequence of moves and pick/drop actions.
We must ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. Starting at c_3_0. We can move to c_0_0 via adjacent cells. Let's examine adjacency list.
Adjacency list includes many pairs. Let's map adjacency graph.
Cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3, c_2_0, c
