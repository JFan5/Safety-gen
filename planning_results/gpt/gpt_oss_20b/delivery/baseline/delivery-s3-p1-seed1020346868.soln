analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?p ?x, at ?t ?x, empty ?t. Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?t ?x, carrying ?t ?p. Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (at p1 c_0_0). Initially: at p1 c_2_0, at t1 c_1_1, empty t1. Constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to satisfy that constraint.
We need to produce a plan that moves truck t1 from c_1_1 to c_0_0 at some point, and eventually deliver package p1 to c_0_0. The truck must pick up the package at its starting location c_2_0, then move to c_0_0, then drop it.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. That will happen when we move to c_0_0. So we need to include that step.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that satisfies the goal and constraint.
We need to consider adjacency relationships. Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_
