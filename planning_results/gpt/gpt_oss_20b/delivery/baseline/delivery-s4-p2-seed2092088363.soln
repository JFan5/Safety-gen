analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Domain: delivery. We have one truck t1, two packages p1 and p2. Goal: both packages at c_3_0. Constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. Also we have adjacency relations. We need to plan moves and pick/drop to deliver both packages to c_3_0.
We need to output plan steps: each line: action name and parameters.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. Starting at c_0_1. So we can move to c_0_0 early.
We need to pick up packages at their initial positions: p1 at c_0_2, p2 at c_1_2. We need to deliver both to c_3_0. So we need to move truck to each package, pick up, then move to c_3_0, drop.
We need to satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we can move to c_0_0 before picking up.
We need to ensure that after dropping, truck may be at c_3_0. But constraint only requires at some point t1 at c_0_0, not necessarily at end.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies all preconditions.
Let's analyze adjacency list: we have adjacency between cells. We need to know adjacency to plan moves.
List of cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3, c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2, c_2_3, c_3_0, c_3_1, c_3_2, c_3_3.
Adjacency pairs given. Let's parse adjacency list:
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_3_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_3_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c
