analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions: pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_3_0) (at p2 c_3_0)). So both packages must be at cell c_3_0.
Initial state: p1 at c_2_0, p2 at c_3_2, t1 at c_3_3, empty t1.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 moves to c_0_0.
We need to deliver both packages to c_3_0. The truck starts at c_3_3. It can move to adjacent cells. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_3_0.
We must also satisfy the constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0.
We need to plan a sequence of moves and pick/drop actions.
We must ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_3_0. The truck can carry only one package at a time? The carrying predicate indicates carrying a package. The truck can carry only one package at a time? The domain doesn't restrict but logically, carrying is a predicate that indicates the truck is carrying a package. It doesn't restrict multiple packages. But we can assume one at a time.
We need to plan: Move truck to p1 location, pick p1, move to c_3_0, drop p1. Then move to p2 location, pick p2, move to c_3_0, drop p2. But we also need to include a move to c_0_0 at some point.
We can incorporate that by moving to c_0_0 after dropping p1, before picking p2.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages at c_3_0. The truck can end anywhere.
We need to produce plan steps in the format: (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...). Use objects defined: cells, packages, truck.
We need to list each action line.
Let's map adjacency: We have adjacency list.
