analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_0) (at p2 c_1_0)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_0.
Initial state: at t1 c_1_1, at p1 c_1_1, at p2 c_1_1, empty t1. Adjacent relationships: c_1_0 adjacent to c_0_0, c_1_1 adjacent to c_1_0, c_0_0 adjacent to c_0_1, etc. So adjacency graph: 2x2 grid: cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1. Adjacent pairs: c_1_0 adjacent to c_0_0 and c_1_1. c_0_0 adjacent to c_1_0 and c_0_1. c_0_1 adjacent to c_0_0 and c_1_1. c_1_1 adjacent to c_1_0 and c_0_1.
Goal: both packages at c_1_0. The truck starts at c_1_1. The truck is empty initially. The truck can pick up packages at its current location if empty. It can drop packages at its current location. It can move to adjacent cells.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). So at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and constraint.
We need to output only plan steps, each line: (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...). Use only objects defined in problem: cells c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1; packages p1, p2; truck t1.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_1_0. The truck can carry packages. The truck can drop them at c_1_0. The truck must be at c
