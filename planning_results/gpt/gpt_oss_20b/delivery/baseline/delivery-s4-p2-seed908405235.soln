analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery domain with actions: pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_3_1) (at p2 c_3_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_3_1.
Initial state: p1 at c_0_0, p2 at c_1_3, t1 at c_2_1, empty t1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to move truck to deliver packages to c_3_1. We can pick up packages, move truck, drop them.
We must ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. Initially it's at c_2_1. So we need to move to c_0_0 at some point. That may be before picking up packages or after.
We need to deliver both packages to c_3_1. The truck can carry only one package at a time? The carrying predicate indicates truck carrying a package. There's no restriction on carrying multiple packages. But we can pick up one at a time.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_3_1. The truck can be anywhere.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages at c_3_1. The truck can be at any cell.
We need to produce plan steps.
Let's analyze adjacency list: many adjacent pairs. We need to know adjacency to move.
We have cells c_0_0 to c_3_3. The adjacency list includes many pairs. We need to know adjacency between cells.
We need to plan path from c_2_1 to c_0_0. Let's check adjacency: adjacent c_2_1 c_3_1, adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0, adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2, adjacent c_2_1 c_1
