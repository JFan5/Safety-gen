analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_2_2) (at p2 c_2_2)). So both packages must be at cell c_2_2.
Initial state: at t1 c_0_1; at p2 c_3_2; at p1 c_1_1; empty t1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver both packages to c_2_2. We can pick up packages, move truck, drop them.
We need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. Starting at c_0_1. Adjacent relationships: we have adjacency list. Let's list adjacency for c_0_1: adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2, adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1, adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0. So c_0_1 adjacent to c_0_2, c_1_1, c_0_0. So we can move to c_0_0.
Goal: both packages at c_2_2. Let's plan.
We need to pick up p1 at c
