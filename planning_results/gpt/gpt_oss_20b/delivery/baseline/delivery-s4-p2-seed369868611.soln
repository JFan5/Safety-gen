analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_2) (at p2 c_0_2)). So both packages must be at cell c_0_2.
Initial state: at p2 c_1_1, at p1 c_3_3, at t1 c_3_3, empty t1. So truck t1 at c_3_3, empty. Packages at c_1_1 and c_3_3.
We need to move both packages to c_0_2. The truck can carry one package at a time. We need to plan a sequence of actions: pick up p2 at c_1_1, move truck to c_0_2, drop p2 at c_0_2. Then pick up p1 at c_3_3, move to c_0_2, drop p1.
But we must also satisfy the constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). That means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where truck goes to c_0_0. That may require moving through adjacent cells.
We need to check adjacency list: many adjacent pairs. Let's list adjacency for each cell:
Given adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent
