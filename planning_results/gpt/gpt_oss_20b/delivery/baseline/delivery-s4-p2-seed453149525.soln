analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (at p1 c_3_3) (at p2 c_3_3). So both packages must be at cell c_3_3.
Initial state: at t1 c_0_0; at p1 c_2_0; at p2 c_1_2; empty t1.
We need to move truck to pick up packages and drop them at c_3_3.
We also have constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. Since initial state already has t1 at c_0_0, that constraint is satisfied. But we must ensure that at some point during plan, t1 is at c_0_0. Since it's already at start, it's satisfied. But we must not move away from c_0_0 before the constraint is satisfied? Actually constraint is satisfied at start, so fine.
We need to produce a plan that moves truck to pick up p1 and p2, then drop them at c_3_3. The truck can carry only one package at a time? The domain doesn't restrict carrying multiple packages. But we can carry one at a time. Let's plan:
1. Move truck from c_0_0 to c_2_0 to pick up p1. But we need adjacency list. Let's examine adjacency
