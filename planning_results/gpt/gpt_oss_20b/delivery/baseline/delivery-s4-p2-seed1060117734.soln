analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_0) (at p2 c_0_0)). So both packages must be at c_0_0.
Initial state: at t1 c_3_3, at p2 c_0_0, at p1 c_1_0, empty t1. So p2 already at goal location. Need to move p1 to c_0_0.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we need to plan a path for truck to reach c_0_0 at some point. Also final state must have p1 at c_0_0.
We need to plan actions: move truck to c_0_0, pick p1 at its current location c_1_0, drop at c_0_0.
But we must ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. That can be after picking and dropping? Actually we need to satisfy constraint: at some point during plan, t1 at c_0_0. So we can have t1 at c_0_0 after dropping p1. That satisfies.
We need to ensure that at the end, p1 at c_0_0. So we can drop at c_0
