analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_0) (at p2 c_0_0)). So both packages at cell c_0_0.
Initial state: at t1 c_1_1; at p1 c_1_0; at p2 c_2_2; empty t1.
Adjacency list: many pairs. We need to move truck t1 to pick up packages and deliver them to c_0_0.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must ensure that at some point, t1 is at c_0_0. That is satisfied if we move to c_0_0 at some point.
Goal: both packages at c_0_0. So we need to pick up p1 from c_1_0, deliver to c_0_0; pick up p2 from c_2_2, deliver to c_0_0. The truck starts at c_1_1.
We need to plan sequence of moves and pick/drop actions.
We must ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. That will happen when we deliver packages.
We need to ensure that after delivering both packages, the truck may be anywhere. But we must satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. That will happen when we drop packages at c_0_0.
We need to produce plan lines: each action line with action name and parameters.
We need to use only objects defined: cells c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2; packages p1, p2; truck t1.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
Let's design plan.
Initial: t1 at c_1_1. p1 at c_1_0. p2 at c_2_2. empty t1.
Goal: p1 at c_0_0,
