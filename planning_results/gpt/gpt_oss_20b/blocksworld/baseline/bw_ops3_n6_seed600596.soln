analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the initial state and goal.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial predicates:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on-table b2
- on b3 b6
- on b4 b1
- on b5 b4
- on b6 b2
- clear b3
- clear b5
Thus initial configuration:
- b1 on table
- b2 on table
- b3 on b6
- b4 on b1
- b5 on b4
- b6 on b2
Clear: b3 and b5 are clear. Let's check: b3 is clear (no block on top). b5 is clear (no block on top). Others: b1 has b4 on it, so not clear. b2 has b6 on it, so not clear. b4 has b5 on it, so not clear. b6 has b3 on it, so not clear. b5 has nothing on top, so clear.
Goal:
- on b1 b6
- on b2 b5
- on-table b3
- on-table b4
- on b5 b1
- on-table b6
Also constraint: sometime-before (on b2 b5) (on b1 b6). Means that at some point before the plan ends, the state (on b2 b5) must hold before (on b1 b6) holds. So we need to ensure that the action sequence respects that ordering: first achieve on b2 b5, then later on b1 b6.
We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal while respecting constraints.
Let's think of a plan.
We need final state: b1 on b6, b2 on b5, b3 on table, b4 on table, b5 on b1, b6 on table.
We need to end with b6 on table. Currently b6 is on b2. So we need to move b6 to table. Also b3 is on b6 currently; we need b3 on table. So we need to move b3 off b6 to table. Also b4 is on b1; we need b4 on table. So we need to move b4 off b1 to table. Also b5 is on b4; we need b5 on b1.
