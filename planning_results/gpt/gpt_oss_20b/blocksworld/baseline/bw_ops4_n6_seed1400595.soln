analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b2 b6) (on b1 b3)". That means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b2 b6) must occur before (on b1 b3). But the goal requires both on b1 b3 and on b2 b6. So we need to ensure that on b2 b6 occurs before on b1 b3. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint. We need to output only action lines.
We need to consider initial state:
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial predicates:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on b2 b1
- on b3 b5
- on-table b4
- on b5 b6
- on b6 b2
- clear b3
- clear b4
So initial stack: b1 on table, b2 on b1, b6 on b2, b5 on b6, b3 on b5. So chain: b3 on b5 on b6 on b2 on b1 on table. b4 on table.
Clear: b3 and b4.
Goal: (on b1 b3) (on b2 b6) (on b4 b2) (on b6 b5).
So we need to arrange:
- b1 on b3
- b2 on b6
- b4 on b2
- b6 on b5
Also constraint: sometime-before (on b2 b6) (on b1 b3). So we must have on b2 b6 before on b1 b3.
We need to produce a plan that achieves these.
We need to consider actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
We need to plan.
Let's analyze initial configuration:
- b1 on table
- b2 on b1
- b6 on b2
- b5 on b6
- b3 on b5
So the stack is: b3 on b5 on b6 on b2 on b1 on table.
Clear: b3 and b4.
Goal: b1 on b3: So we need to put b1 on top of b3. But currently b3 is on top of b5. So
