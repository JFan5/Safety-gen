analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b4 b3) (on b1 b2)". That means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b4 b3) must occur before (on b1 b2). But the goal requires both on b1 b2 and on b4 b3. So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving on b1 b2, we have on b4 b3. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and constraint. We need to output only action lines.
We need to consider initial state: arm-empty, on-table b1, on-table b2, on b3 b5, on-table b4, on b5 b6, on b6 b4, clear b1, clear b2, clear b3. Wait: initial state: on b3 b5 means b3 is on b5. on b5 b6 means b5 on b6. on b6 b4 means b6 on b4. So we have a stack: b3 on b5 on b6 on b4. So b4 is on table. b3 is on b5. b5 on b6. b6 on b4. So b4 is on table. b3 is on b5. So b3 is not clear. b5 is not clear because b3 on it. b6 is not clear because b5 on it. b4 is clear? Wait: b4 has b6 on it, so b4 is not clear. Actually b4 has b6 on it, so b4 is not clear. So clear b4? No. So clear b4 is false. But initial state says clear b3. But b3 is on b5, so b3 is not clear. But initial state says clear b3. That seems inconsistent. But maybe they consider clear b3 means no block on top of b3. But b3 has nothing on top of it, so it's clear. So clear b3 is true. So clear b3 is fine.
Also clear b1, clear b2. So b1 and b2 are on table and clear.
Goal: on b1 b2, on b4 b3, on b5 b4, on b6 b1. So we need to end with b1 on b2
