analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b3 b6) (on b2 b5)". That means at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b6) must hold before (on b2 b5). But the goal requires both on b2 b5 and on b3 b6 and on b4 b1. The constraint says that at some point before achieving (on b2 b5), the state (on b3 b6) must have been true. So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, we have on b3 b6. But the goal itself includes on b3 b6, so that condition is satisfied at the end. But the constraint requires that at some point before achieving (on b2 b5), we had (on b3 b6). That could be at the end? Wait, the constraint is "sometime-before (on b3 b6) (on b2 b5)". This means that at some point before the goal (on b2 b5) is achieved, the state (on b3 b6) must have been true. But the goal includes (on b3 b6). So we need to ensure that before achieving (on b2 b5), we had (on b3 b6). But if we achieve (on b3 b6) at the same time as (on b2 b5), that might not satisfy the constraint because the constraint requires that (on b3 b6) holds at some point before (on b2 b5). So we need to achieve (on b3 b6) earlier, then later achieve (on b2 b5). But the goal includes both, so we need to achieve (on b3 b6) first, then (on b2 b5). But we also need to achieve (on b4 b1). So we need to plan accordingly.
Let's analyze the initial state:
Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6.
Initial predicates:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on b2 b3
- on-table b3
- on b4 b6
- on-table b5
- on-table b6
- clear b1
- clear b2
- clear b4
- clear b5
Wait, we need to parse the initial state
