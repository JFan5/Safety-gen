analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. Predicates: clear, on-table, arm-empty, holding, on.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on b2 b6
- on-table b3
- on b4 b5
- on b5 b1
- on b6 b3
- clear b2
- clear b4
Let's parse: "on b2 b6" means block b2 is on block b6. "on b4 b5" means b4 on b5. "on b5 b1" means b5 on b1. "on b6 b3" means b6 on b3.
Also clear b2: b2 has nothing on top. clear b4: b4 has nothing on top.
Goal:
- on b1 b6
- on b3 b2
- on b4 b3
- on b5 b4
- on b6 b5
So we need to arrange blocks accordingly.
Constraint: (sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b6)). Means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b2) must hold before (on b1 b6) holds. So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving (on b1 b6), we have (on b3 b2). That is, we must have b3 on b2 before we place b1 on b6.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and constraint.
We need to produce a sequence of actions.
Let's analyze initial configuration:
- b1 on table
- b2 on b6
- b3 on table
- b4 on b5
- b5 on b1
- b6 on b3
- clear b2
- clear b4
So initial stack: b6 on b3, b2 on b6, b5 on b1, b4 on b5. So we have:
- Table: b1, b3
- b1 has b5 on it
- b5 has b4 on it
- b3 has b6 on it
- b6 has b2 on it
