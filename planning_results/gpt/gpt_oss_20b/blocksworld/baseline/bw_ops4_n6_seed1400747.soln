analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b4 b3) (on b3 b1)". That means at some point before the goal, the state (on b4 b3) must hold before (on b3 b1) holds. But the goal requires (on b3 b1) and (on b4 b3) and (on b5 b2). So we need to achieve these while respecting the constraint: at some point before achieving (on b3 b1), we must have (on b4 b3). So we need to ensure that (on b4 b3) holds before (on b3 b1). But the goal also requires (on b4 b3). So we need to have (on b4 b3) hold at some point before (on b3 b1). But the goal also requires (on b4 b3). So we can satisfy by achieving (on b4 b3) early, then later (on b3 b1). But the goal also requires (on b4 b3) at the end. So we can achieve (on b4 b3) early, then later (on b3 b1). But we must also achieve (on b5 b2). Let's analyze initial state:
Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6.
Initial facts:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b2
- on-table b2
- on b3 b4
- on b4 b1
- on b5 b3
- on b6 b5
- clear b6
Thus initial stack: b2 on table, b1 on b2, b4 on b1, b3 on b4, b5 on b3, b6 on b5. So the stack is: table -> b2 -> b1 -> b4 -> b3 -> b5 -> b6. Wait check: on b5 b3 means b5 on b3. So b5 is on top of b3. Then b6 on b5. So the stack is: table (b2) -> b1 -> b4 -> b3 -> b5 -> b6. So b6 is topmost.
Goal: (on b3 b1) means b3 on b1. (on b4 b3) means b4 on b3. (on
