analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's parse the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on b2 b1
- on b3 b4
- on b4 b5
- on b5 b2
- on b6 b3
- clear b6
So initial configuration: Let's visualize.
b1 on table. b2 on b1. b5 on b2. b4 on b5. b3 on b4. b6 on b3. b6 is clear. So stack: b1 (table) -> b2 -> b5 -> b4 -> b3 -> b6. Wait check: on b3 b4 means b3 on b4. So b3 on b4. Then on b4 b5: b4 on b5. on b5 b2: b5 on b2. So chain: b1 (table) -> b2 -> b5 -> b4 -> b3 -> b6. Yes.
Goal:
- on b2 b1
- on b3 b5
- on b4 b3
- on b5 b6
- on b6 b2
So final configuration: b2 on b1 (already true initially). b3 on b5, b4 on b3, b5 on b6, b6 on b2. Let's see if that is possible.
We need to rearrange the stack accordingly.
Also constraint: (sometime-before (on b3 b5) (on b2 b1)). Means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b5) must hold before (on b2 b1) holds. But the goal requires both. The constraint says that at some point before the goal, (on b3 b5) must hold before (on b2 b1). But the goal already has (on b2 b1). So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving (on b2 b1), we had (on b3 b5). That means we need to achieve (on b3 b5) before achieving (on b2 b1). But the goal includes (on b2 b1) as a goal condition. So we need
