analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the initial state and goal.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial predicates:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b5
- on b2 b4
- on b3 b1
- on-table b4
- on b5 b2
- on-table b6
- clear b3
- clear b6
So initial configuration:
- b1 is on b5
- b5 is on b2
- b2 is on b4
- b3 is on b1
- b4 is on table
- b6 is on table
Clear: b3 and b6 are clear. Also, b1 is not clear because something on it? Wait b1 has b3 on it, so b1 is not clear. b5 has b1 on it, so b5 not clear. b2 has b5 on it, so b2 not clear. b4 has b2 on it, so b4 not clear. b6 is clear and on table.
Goal:
- on b1 b5
- on b2 b1
- on b4 b3
- on b5 b4
- on b6 b2
Also constraint: sometime-before (on b2 b1) (on b1 b5). Means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b2 b1) must hold before (on b1 b5) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that at some point before achieving (on b1 b5), we had (on b2 b1). But the goal includes (on b2 b1) as well. So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving (on b1 b5), we had (on b2 b1). But we can just achieve (on b2 b1) earlier, then later achieve (on b1 b5). But the goal includes both, so we need to satisfy the constraint: at some point before achieving (on b1 b5), we must have (on b2 b1). So we need to plan accordingly.
Let's analyze the initial state: b2 is on b4, not on b1. So we need to eventually have b2 on b1. That means we need to move b2 onto b1. But b1 currently has b3 on it
