analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b3
- on-table b2
- on b3 b2
- on-table b4
- on b5 b6
- on b6 b4
- clear b1
- clear b5
So initial configuration: Let's visualize.
- b1 is on b3. So b1 is on top of b3. b3 is on b2. So stack: b2 at bottom, b3 on top of b2, b1 on top of b3. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3 on b2. So b1 is on b3, b3
