analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on b1 b2)". That means at some point before the action that achieves on b2 b3, the action that achieves on b1 b2 must have happened. Wait: The constraint is "sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on b1 b2)". Usually, constraints are of the form: (sometime-before A B) meaning A must occur before B. But here it's (sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on b1 b2)). So the action that achieves on b2 b3 must happen after the action that achieves on b1 b2. So we need to ensure that the action that puts b1 on b2 occurs before the action that puts b2 on b3.
Goal: (on b1 b2) AND (on b2 b3) AND (on b3 b5). So final arrangement: b1 on b2, b2 on b3, b3 on b5. So stack: b5 at bottom, then b3 on b5, then b2 on b3, then b1 on b2. So final stack: b5 bottom, b3 above, b2 above, b1 top.
We need to produce a plan that achieves that while respecting constraints. Also initial state: b1, b2, b3 on table; b4 on b2; b6 on b4; b5 on table. Clear: b1, b3, b5, b6. So b4 is on b2, b6 on b4. So b2 has something on it (b4). So b2 is not clear. b4 is on b2, so b4 is not clear. b6 is on b4, so b6 is not clear. So b4 is clear? Wait: b4 is on b2, so b4 is not clear. b6 is on b4, so b6 is not clear. So b4 is not clear. b6 is not clear. So b2 is not clear. So b1, b3, b5, b6 are clear. b2 is not clear. b4 is not clear. b6 is not clear.
Goal requires b2 to be clear? Actually goal requires on b2 b3, so b2
