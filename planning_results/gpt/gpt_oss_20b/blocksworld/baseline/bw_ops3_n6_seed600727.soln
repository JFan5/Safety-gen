analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b2
- on b2 b5
- on b3 b1
- on-table b4
- on-table b5
- on b6 b3
- clear b4
- clear b6
Goal:
- on-table b1
- on b2 b4
- on b3 b6
- on b4 b3
- on-table b5
- on-table b6
Constraints: (sometime-before (on b2 b4) (on-table b1))
Interpretation: The action that achieves on b2 b4 must happen before the action that achieves on-table b1. So we need to ensure that the action that puts b2 on b4 occurs before the action that puts b1 on-table.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that transforms initial state to goal while satisfying constraints.
We need to output only action lines.
We need to find a plan.
Let's analyze initial configuration:
- b1 on b2
- b2 on b5
- b3 on b1
- b4 on-table
- b5 on-table
- b6 on b3
- clear b4
- clear b6
Thus stack: b1 on b2 on b5. b3 on b1. b6 on b3. So chain: b6 on b3 on b1 on b2 on b5. b4 on-table. b5 on-table. b6 on b3.
Goal:
- b1 on-table
- b2 on b4
- b3 on b6
- b4 on b3
- b5 on-table
- b6 on-table
So we need to rearrange.
Let's think of plan.
We need to end with b1 on-table. That means we need to remove b1 from being on b2. So we need to unstack b1 from b2. But b1 is on b2, and b2 is on b5. So we need to unstack b1 from b2, then put it on-table.
But we also need b2 on b4. So we need to stack b2 onto
