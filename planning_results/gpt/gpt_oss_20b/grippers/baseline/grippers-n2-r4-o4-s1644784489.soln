analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3 room4; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3 ball4.
Initial state: robot1 at room3; robot2 at room3. Both robots free on both grippers. ball1 at room1; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room4.
Goal: ball1 at room4; ball2 at room2; ball3 at room1; ball4 at room1.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room1)). So robot1 cannot be at room1 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms.
We need to move ball1 from room1 to room4. ball2 from room1 to room2. ball3 from room3 to room1. ball4 from room4 to room1.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room1. So robot1 cannot move to room1. But robot2 can.
We can use robot2 to move objects to room1. But robot2 can be at room1. But robot1 cannot.
We need to plan sequence.
We need to consider that each robot can carry at most one object per gripper. They have two grippers each.
We need to plan moves.
Let's think:
