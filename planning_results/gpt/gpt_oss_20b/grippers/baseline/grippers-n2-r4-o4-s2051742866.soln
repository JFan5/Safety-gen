analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room4
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room1
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room2
- at ball4 room4
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room3
- at ball4 room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball3 to room3 and ball4 to room1, while keeping robot1 never in room3.
We have two robots: robot1 and robot2. Robot1 starts at room4, robot2 at room1. Robot1 cannot go to room3. Robot2 can go anywhere.
We need to move ball3 from
