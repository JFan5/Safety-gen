analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1 room2 room3, objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room2
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room2
Goal: all balls at room1.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to move ball3 from room2 to room1. Also ball1 and ball2 already at room1. So only need to move ball3.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. We need to get ball3 to room1. Robot1 or robot2 can do it. But constraint prohibits robot1 from being at room3. But we can use robot2 to move to room1 via room2? Wait robot2 starts at room2. It can move to room1 directly? There's no direct connection specified. The
