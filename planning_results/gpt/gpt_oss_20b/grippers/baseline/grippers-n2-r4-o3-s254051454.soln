analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
precondition: (at-robby ?r ?from)
effect: (at-robby ?r ?to) and (not (at-robby ?r ?from))
pick: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: (at ?obj ?room) (at-robby ?r ?room) (free ?r ?g)
effect: (carry ?r ?obj ?g) (not (at ?obj ?room)) (not (free ?r ?g))
drop: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: (carry ?r ?obj ?g) (at-robby ?r ?room)
effect: (at ?obj ?room) (free ?r ?g) (not (carry ?r ?obj ?g))
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room2
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room4
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room1
Goal: at ball1 room1, at ball2 room2, at ball3 room3.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time.
We need to move balls to rooms 2 and 3 accordingly. Robot1 starts at room2, robot2 at room4. They can move between rooms. They have two grippers each: rgripper1, lgripper
