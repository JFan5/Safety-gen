analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room2
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room4
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room1
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room3
- ball4 at room4
Goal:
- ball1 at room1
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room2
- ball4 at room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions while respecting constraints.
We have two robots. They can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects if free.
Goal: ball1 at room1 (already at room1 initially). ball2 at room3. ball3 at room2. ball4 at room1.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room2, ball4 from room4
