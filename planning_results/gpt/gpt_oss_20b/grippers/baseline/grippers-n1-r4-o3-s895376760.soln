analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1 at room2. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1. Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4. Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))) meaning robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1. So robot1 cannot use lgripper1 to carry objects. So only rgripper1 can be used to carry objects. So we must ensure that robot1 never carries an object with lgripper1. So we can only use rgripper1 to carry objects. So we need to move robot to appropriate rooms and pick/dropp.
We need to deliver ball1 to room1, ball2 stays at room2, ball3 to room4.
Initial: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4.
We need to move ball3 from room1 to room4. We need to move ball1 from room2 to room1. ball2 stays at room2.
We need to plan sequence of moves.
Robot starts at room2. It can pick ball1 or ball2. But we need to deliver ball1 to room1. So we can pick ball1, move to room1, drop. But we also need to deliver ball3 to room4
