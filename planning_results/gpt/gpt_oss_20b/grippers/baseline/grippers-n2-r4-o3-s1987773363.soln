analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
precondition: (at-robby ?r ?from)
effect: (at-robby ?r ?to) and not (at-robby ?r ?from)
pick: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: (at ?obj ?room) (at-robby ?r ?room) (free ?r ?g)
effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g
drop: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room
effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room4
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room3.
Constraints: always not (at-robby robot1 room3 and at-robby robot2 room3). So they cannot both be in room3 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room1, ball2 from room3 to room
