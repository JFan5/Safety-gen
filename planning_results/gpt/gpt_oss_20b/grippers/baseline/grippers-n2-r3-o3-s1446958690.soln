analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks up object. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1, room2, room3; objects: ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room1
Goal:
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room2
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room2)). So robot1 must never be in room2.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball1 to room3, ball3 to room2, ball2 stays in room1. Robot1 cannot go to room2. Robot2 can go anywhere.
We need to use grippers to pick up objects. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects with either gripper. The free predicate indicates that a gr
