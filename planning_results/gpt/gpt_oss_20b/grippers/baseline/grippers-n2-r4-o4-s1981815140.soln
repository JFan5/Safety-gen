analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in same room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-4.
Initial state: robot1 at room1, robot2 at room2. Both robots free all grippers. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room3.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room1, ball4 at room1.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We need to consider that robots can carry one object at a time per gripper? Actually each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects with either gripper. They can carry objects simultaneously? The predicates: carry robot object gripper. So each gripper can carry one object. So robot can carry up to two objects at once, one per gripper.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room2. ball2 stays at room4 (goal same). ball3 from room4 to room1. ball4 from room3 to room1.
We need to plan moves for robots.
We must avoid robot1 being at room3 at any time. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can be at room3? Constraint only mentions robot1. So robot
