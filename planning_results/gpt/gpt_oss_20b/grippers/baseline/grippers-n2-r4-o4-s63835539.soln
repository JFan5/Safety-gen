analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4; objects: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room4
- at ball3 room3
- at ball4 room3
Goal:
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room1
- at ball4 room3
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms, respecting constraints.
We have two robots. They can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick objects with either gripper. They can carry only one object
