analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3 room4; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3 ball4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room2
- at ball4 room3
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room4
- at ball4 room4
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room1. ball2 stays in room2 (already at goal). ball3 from room2 to room4. ball4 from room3 to room4.
We need to ensure robot1 never goes to room3. So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. But robot1 starts at room1. Robot2 starts at room2.
We can use robot2
