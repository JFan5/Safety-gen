analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the gripper problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
pick: robot picks up object in same room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1, grippers rgripper1 and lgripper1. Rooms 1-4. Objects ball1, ball2, ball3. Initial: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room4, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room3.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4.
Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))). So robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1 at any time. So robot1 can only use rgripper1 to carry objects. So we must ensure that when robot picks up an object, it uses rgripper1, not lgripper1.
We need to produce a plan that moves robot to appropriate rooms, picks up objects, drops them at goal locations, respecting constraints.
We need to ensure that at any time, robot1 is not carrying an object with lgripper1. So we must never use lgripper1 to carry. But we can use lgripper1 to free it (free robot1 lgripper1). But we cannot carry with lgripper1. So we can use lgripper1 to pick up? Wait pick action requires free
