analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1-4, objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state: robot1 at room1, robot2 at room4. Both robots free on both grippers. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room1.
Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
Constraints: always not both robots at room4 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that achieves goal while respecting constraints.
We need to plan moves for robots to transport balls to target rooms.
Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
Currently ball3 already at room1, so no action needed for ball3.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room4. ball2 from room4 to room2.
We have two robots. They can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects with either gripper.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
We must ensure that at no time both robots are at room4 simultaneously. Initially robot2 is at room4. Robot1 at room1. So we must avoid moving robot1 to room4 while robot2 still there. But robot2 may move away from room4 to somewhere else. But we need to deliver ball2 to room2
