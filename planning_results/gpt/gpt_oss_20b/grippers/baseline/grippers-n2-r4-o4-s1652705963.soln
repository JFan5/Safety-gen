analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state: robot1 at room4; robot1 free rgripper1, lgripper1; robot2 at room4; robot2 free rgripper2, lgripper2; ball1 at room3; ball2 at room3; ball3 at room1; ball4 at room1.
Goal: ball1 at room2; ball2 at room3; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room3.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots. They can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects if free.
Goal: ball1 to room2, ball2 stays at room3, ball3 to room3, ball4 to room3.
Initial: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room1, ball4 at room1.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room2. ball3 and ball4 from room1 to room3.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can.
We need to plan moves.
