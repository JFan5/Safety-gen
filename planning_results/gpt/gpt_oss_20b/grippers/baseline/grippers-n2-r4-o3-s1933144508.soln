analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot r, from, to. Precondition: at-robby r from. Effect: at-robby r to, not at-robby r from.
pick: robot r, object obj, room room, gripper g. Precondition: at obj room, at-robby r room, free r g. Effect: carry r obj g, not at obj room, not free r g.
drop: robot r, object obj, room room, gripper g. Precondition: carry r obj g, at-robby r room. Effect: at obj room, free r g, not carry r obj g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3 room4; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room4
- at ball3 room4
Goal: at ball1 room4, at ball2 room2, at ball3 room1.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room1 to room4. ball2 from room4 to room2. ball3 from room4 to room1.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room4. So robot1 cannot move to room4. But robot2 can.
We need to plan moves.
We need to consider that robots can move between rooms. The rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4. Robot1 starts at room3. Robot2 starts at room
