analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room2)). So robot1 cannot be in room2 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to the goal rooms, respecting constraints.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms.
We need to move ball1 from room2 to room1, ball2 from room3 to room2, ball3 from room4 to room1.
We need to ensure robot1 never enters room2. So robot1 cannot move to room2.
