analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room1
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room2
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room4
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room4
- ball4 at room2
Goal:
- ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room4
Constraints: always not both robot1 and robot2 at room4 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room2; ball2 stays at room3 (already at goal); ball3 from room4 to room1; ball4 from room2 to room4.
We need to ensure that at no point both robots are at room4 simultaneously.
We can plan a sequence of moves.
We need to consider that robots can move between rooms. They start at room1 and room2.
We need to move ball1 to room2: ball1 currently at room4. So robot1 or robot2 must pick it up and drop at room2.
Similarly ball3 from
