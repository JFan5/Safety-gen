analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1-4, objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room4
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room3
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 must never be at room3.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball1 from room3 to room1, ball2 stays at room2 (already at room2), ball3 from room4 to room3. Also robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We have two robots: robot1 and robot2. Robot1 starts at room1, robot2 at room3. Robot2 can move to other rooms. Robot1 cannot go to room3. So robot1 can move to room2, room4, etc. But robot1 cannot be
