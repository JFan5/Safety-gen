analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4; objects: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room4
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
- at ball4 room3
Goal:
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
- at ball4 room4
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball1 and ball4 to room4, while ball2 stays at room3, ball3 stays at room4. Robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time. Robot2 can be at room4.
We need to move ball1 from room3
