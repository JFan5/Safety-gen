analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks up object in same room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1 room2 room3, objects ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room2
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room3
Constraints: (always (not (at-robby robot1 gripper))) Wait: "gripper" is not defined as a room. The constraint says robot1 cannot be at "gripper" location. But "gripper" is not a room. This constraint is weird: maybe it's a typo. But we must satisfy it: robot1 cannot be at location "gripper". Since "gripper" is not a room, it's irrelevant. So we ignore.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room2, ball3 from room2 to room3, ball1 stays at room1. Robot1 and robot2 start
