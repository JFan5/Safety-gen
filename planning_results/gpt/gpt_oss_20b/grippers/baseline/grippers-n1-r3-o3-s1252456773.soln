analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1, grippers rgripper1 and lgripper1. Rooms: room1, room2, room3. Objects: ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial state: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room1.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
Constraints: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))). So robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1. So robot1 must use rgripper1 to carry objects.
We need to move ball2 from room3 to room2. ball1 already at room2. ball3 already at room1. So we need to move ball2 to room2. Robot starts at room1. It can move to room3, pick ball2 with rgripper1, move to room2, drop ball2. But we must ensure that robot1 never carries with lgripper1. So we must use rgripper1 for carrying.
Also we need to ensure that robot1 can pick ball2. Precondition: at ball2 room3, at-robby robot1 room3, free robot1 rgripper1. So we need to move robot1 to room3. Initially at room1. So we need to move robot1 to room3. But we need to consider that robot1 can move from room
