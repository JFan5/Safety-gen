analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1, grippers rgripper1 and lgripper1. Rooms 1-4. Objects ball1, ball2, ball3 all initially at room2. Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3. Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))) meaning robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1 at any time. So robot1 must only use rgripper1 to carry objects. So we must ensure that at all times, robot1 never carries an object with lgripper1. So we cannot use lgripper1 to carry objects. But we can use it to drop? Actually drop action requires carry robot object gripper. So if we use lgripper1, that would violate constraint. So we must only use rgripper1 for carrying. But we can still use lgripper1 for free? The constraint says: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))). So at any time, carry robot1 ?b lgripper1 must be false. So we cannot have carry robot1 ?b lgripper1. So we cannot use lgripper1 to carry objects. But we can still use lgripper1 to be free or not? The constraint only restricts carry. So we can use lgripper1 to be free or not. But we cannot carry objects with lgripper1. So we must use rgripper1
