analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1, grippers rgripper1, lgripper1. Rooms: room1-4. Objects: ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4.
Constraints: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b rgripper1))). Means robot1 cannot carry any object with rgripper1. So robot1 must use lgripper1 to carry objects. So we cannot use rgripper1 to carry any object. But we can still use lgripper1.
We need to move robot to pick up ball1 from room3, move to room2, drop ball1. Then ball2 is already at room1, goal satisfied. ball3 from room2 to room4. So we need to pick ball3 from room2, move to room4, drop.
We must ensure that robot never carries with rgripper1. So we must use lgripper1 for both picks.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
We need to consider that robot can only carry one object at a time. So we need to pick ball1, move to room2, drop. Then pick ball3, move to room4, drop.
But we also need to ensure that robot ends at some location. Not specified. But we
