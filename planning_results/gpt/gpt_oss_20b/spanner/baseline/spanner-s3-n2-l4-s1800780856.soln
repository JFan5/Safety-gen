analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: parameters (?start - location ?end - location ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man ?n - nut). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Problem: objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3 (spanner), nut1, nut2 (nut), location1-4, shed, gate.
Init: bob at shed. spanner1,2,3 at location2, useable. nut1, nut2 loose at gate. Links: shed-location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4.
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. He can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to pick spanner(s) to tighten nuts. Spanners are at location2. Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location2 to pick up spanner(s). He can walk along links: shed -> location1 -> location2. Then he can pick up a spanner at location2. Then he must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanner must be useable. After tightening, spanner becomes not useable. So we
