analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner domain with actions: walk, pickup_spanner, tighten_nut.
Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, nut1, nut2, location1-4, shed, gate.
Initial state: bob at shed. spanner1 at location3, useable spanner1. spanner2 at location3, useable spanner2. spanner3 at location4, useable spanner3. nut1 loose at gate. nut2 loose at gate. Links: shed-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-gate.
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints: (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)) meaning nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). So bob can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So after leaving, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that bob must walk to location where nuts are (gate). He must pick up a spanner at location3 or 4? Spanners are at location3 and 4. Nuts at gate. So bob must walk from shed to location1,2,3,4, gate. He can walk along links. He cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must go from shed to location1, then to location2, then to location3, then to location4, then to gate. He can pick up spanner at location3 or 4. He can use spanner to tighten nuts at gate.
But spanner must be at same location as nut to tighten. So spanner must be at gate. But spanners are at location3 or 4. So bob must walk to location3 or 4, pick up spanner, then walk to gate, then tighten nuts.
But spanner must be at same location as nut to tighten. So spanner must be at gate. So bob must walk to gate with spanner. But spanner is at location3 or 4. So he must walk to location3 or 4, pick up spanner, then walk to gate.
