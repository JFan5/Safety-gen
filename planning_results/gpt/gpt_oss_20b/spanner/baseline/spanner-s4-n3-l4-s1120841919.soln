analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must not include walking back to shed.
Also at-most-once constraint: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since bob starts at shed, that's one occurrence. He cannot go back to shed again. So we must avoid walking back to shed.
Also we have link relations: link shed location1, location4 gate, location1 location2, location2 location3, location3 location4. So graph: shed - location1 - location2 - location3 - location4 - gate. Also link location4 gate. So path from shed to gate via location1-2-3-4.
Spanners: spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location4, spanner4 at location3. All useable.
Nuts: nut1, nut2, nut3 at gate. All loose.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Must satisfy constraint: nut1 tightened before nut2. No constraint on nut3 relative to others.
We need to produce a plan: bob must walk to gate, pick
