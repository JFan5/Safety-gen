analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). Means nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1? Actually link shed location1. So he can walk to location1. Then to location2, location3, location4, etc. Spanners are at location4, location3. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are at location4 and location3. He must pick up a spanner at location4 or location3. But nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanner must be at same location as nut to tighten. So Bob must walk to gate, but spanner is not at gate. So he must bring spanner to gate. He can walk to location4, pick up spanner1, walk to gate? But there is no link from location4 to gate? Wait link location4 gate exists. Yes link location4 gate. So Bob can walk from location4 to gate. So plan: walk from shed to location1, location2, location3, location4, then to gate. But spanner1 at location4. So Bob picks
