analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end location for a man. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
3. tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying m s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must not include walking back to shed.
Also at-most-once constraint: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Means each man can be at shed at most once. So if bob starts at shed, he can be at shed only at start. So he cannot return to shed. So we must avoid walking back to shed.
We need to tighten nut1 and nut2. They are at gate initially. Spanners are at locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location1. All useable initially.
We need to get spanner to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are not at gate. We need to walk to gate. But we cannot walk back to shed. So we can walk from shed to location1, then to location2, location3, location4, then to gate? Wait, link: location4 gate. So we can walk from location4 to gate. But we need to get spanner to gate. We can pick up spanner at location4 (spanner1). Then walk to
