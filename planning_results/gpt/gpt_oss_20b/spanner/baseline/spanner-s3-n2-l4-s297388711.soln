analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: parameters (?start - location ?end - location ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man ?n - nut). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Problem objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, nut1, nut2, location1-4, shed, gate.
Initial state:
- at bob shed
- at spanner1 location1
- useable spanner1
- at spanner2 location4
- useable spanner2
- at spanner3 location4
- useable spanner3
- loose nut1
- at nut1 gate
- loose nut2
- at nut2 gate
- link shed location1
- link location4 gate
- link location1 location2
- link location2 location3
- link location3 location4
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed))
So bob can only be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must go to location1, then to location2, location3, location4, gate? Wait gate is a location. He can walk from shed to location1, then to location2, location3, location4, then to gate? But link location4 gate exists. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location
