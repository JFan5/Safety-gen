analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end location, requires at ?m ?start and link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: requires at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: requires at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So plan must not have him return to shed after leaving.
Also at-most-once constraint: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Means each time he is at shed, count. He starts at shed. He can leave, but cannot come back. So we must not have him return to shed. So we must avoid walking back to shed.
We need to tighten all nuts at gate location. All nuts are at gate. Spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location2, spanner4 at location4. Useable spanners at all. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed->location1, location4->gate, location1->location2, location2->location3, location3->location4. So path: shed to location1 to location2 to location3 to location4 to gate. Also location4 to gate. So Bob can walk from shed to location1, then to location2, then to location3, then to location4, then to gate. He cannot return to shed. So plan: walk to location1, pick up
