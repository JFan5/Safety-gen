analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner domain with actions: walk, pickup_spanner, tighten_nut.
Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Objects: bob (man), spanner1-4, nut1-3, location1-5, shed, gate.
Initial state: bob at shed. Spanners at locations: spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location5, spanner4 at location4. All spanners useable. Nuts loose at gate. Links: shed-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-gate. So path from shed to gate via 1-2-3-4-5.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3. Constraints: sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also at-most-once (at ?m shed) for all men: bob can be at shed at most once. So bob cannot return to shed after leaving.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1, then to 2, etc. He must pick up a spanner at each location to tighten nuts at gate. But spanners are at various locations; he can pick up spanner at location2,3,4,5. But nuts are at gate. So he must walk to gate to tighten nuts. He can carry a spanner to gate. He can use spanner to tighten nuts. He must use a spanner that is useable. After using, spanner becomes not useable. But we can pick up spanner at location2, then walk to gate, tighten nut1, then maybe pick up another spanner at location3, etc. But spanners are at different locations; we can use each spanner once. But we need to tighten all three nuts. We have 4 spanners. So we can use spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location5, spanner4 at location4. But we need to use them to tighten nuts. We can use spanner1 to tighten nut1, spanner2 to tighten nut2, spanner3 to tighten nut3. But we
