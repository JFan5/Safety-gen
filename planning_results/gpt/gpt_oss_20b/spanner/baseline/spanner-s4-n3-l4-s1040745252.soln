analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed again. So he must leave shed and never return.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 4 locations: location1, location2, location3, location4. Also shed and gate. Links: shed-location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. So Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1, then location2, etc. He cannot return to shed. So he must go out and never back.
Spanners: spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location3, spanner4 at location1. All useable.
Nut1 at gate, loose. Nut2 at gate, loose. Nut3 at gate, loose.
Goal: tighten all nuts. He must pick up a spanner at each location where nuts are? Actually nuts are at gate. So Bob must reach gate to tighten nuts. He must bring a spanner to gate. He can pick up spanner at location1, location2, location
