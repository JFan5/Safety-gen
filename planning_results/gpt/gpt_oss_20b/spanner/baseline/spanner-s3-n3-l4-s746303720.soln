analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?l, at ?s ?l, at ?m ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). Means nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 3 nuts at gate. Spanners at locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location2. Bob at shed. Links: shed->location1, location4->gate, location1->location2, location2->location3, location3->location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob can walk along these links.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Each nut at gate. Bob must pick up a spanner at some location, walk to gate, tighten nuts. Useable spanner becomes not useable after tightening a nut. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 3 spanners, 3 nuts. So we can use each spanner to tighten one nut.
Constraints: Bob cannot return to shed. So he must leave shed and not come back. That's fine.
Also, the constraint: sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3. So we need to
