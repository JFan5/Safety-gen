analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1, location2, location3, location4, gate? Wait, link graph: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> gate. So Bob can walk to gate via these links. He must pick up spanners at location3 or location4. Spanners are at location3 (spanner1 and spanner3) and location4 (spanner2). All spanners are useable initially. He must tighten nuts at gate. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate, pick up a spanner, tighten nuts. But constraints: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Bob starts at shed, so that's one. He cannot return to shed again. So he must not walk back to shed. That's fine.
Also, constraint: sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3. So order: tighten nut2 first, then nut3. Nut1 can be tightened anytime.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies all constraints. Let's
