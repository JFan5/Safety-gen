analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 3 nuts all at gate location. Spanners at locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed->location1, location4->gate, location1->location2, location2->location3, location3->location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob must walk to gate to reach nuts. He can pick up spanner at location1 or location2 or location4. He must use a spanner to tighten nuts. Useable spanner is initially useable. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. We need to tighten all nuts. We have 3 spanners, 3 nuts. So we can use each spanner to tighten one nut. But we must satisfy constraint: nut2 tightened before nut3. So order: nut2 before nut3. No constraint on nut1 relative to others.
We need to produce plan steps: walk, pickup_spanner, tighten_nut
