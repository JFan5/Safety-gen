analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). Means nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1? Actually link shed location1. So Bob can walk to location1. Then to location2, location3, location4, etc. Spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1, spanner4 at location2. Nuts are at gate. So nuts are at gate location. But Bob is at shed initially. He must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate. But link location4 gate, location3 location4, etc. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. But we need to ensure that Bob doesn't return to shed. He can leave shed and never return. That's fine.
We need to pick up a spanner at some location to tighten nuts. Spanners are at location1, location2, location4. Spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1, spanner4 at location2. Useable spanners. Useable spanner
