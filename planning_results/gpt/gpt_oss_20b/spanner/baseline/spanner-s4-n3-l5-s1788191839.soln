analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 4 spanners at locations: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location5, spanner4 at location4. All useable initially.
Nuts: nut1, nut2, nut3 at gate location. All loose.
Links: shed - location1, location5 - gate, location1-2-3-4-5 chain.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Use spanners. Each spanner can be used once? Actually useable predicate indicates spanner is useable. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. But we have 4 spanners, enough to tighten 3 nuts.
We need to plan sequence of actions: Bob must walk to location of nuts, pick up spanner, tighten nuts. Must satisfy constraint: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Bob starts at shed. He can leave shed and cannot return. So we must not have Bob return to shed after leaving. So we must not have any walk back to shed. That's fine.
Also constraint: sometime
