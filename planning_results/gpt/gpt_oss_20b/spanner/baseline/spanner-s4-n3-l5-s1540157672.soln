analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying m s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must avoid returning to shed.
Also, at-most-once constraint: at-most-once (at ?m shed). Means that the predicate (at ?m shed) can be true at most once across the plan. Since initial state has bob at shed, that's one occurrence. After he leaves, he cannot return to shed. So we must not have any action that puts bob back at shed.
Also, we must satisfy the constraint that nut1 tightened before nut2. So order: tighten nut1, then nut2. Nut3 can be tightened anytime after that? No constraint on nut3 relative to others.
We need to produce a plan that uses spanners to tighten nuts. Spanners are at location2 initially. Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1? Wait, link shed location1. So he can walk from shed to location1. Then from location1 to location2. Then from location2 to location3, etc. Nuts are at gate. Gate is connected to location5 via link location5 gate. And location5 is connected to location4, etc.
