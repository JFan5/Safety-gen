analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying m s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must avoid returning to shed.
We need to tighten all nuts. They are at gate initially. Spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location1, spanner4 at location3. All spanners are useable initially. Bob starts at shed. He must walk to somewhere to get spanner, then tighten nuts at gate. But spanners are not at gate. He must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are at locations 1,3,4. He can walk to those locations, pick up spanner, then walk to gate, tighten nuts. But spanner must be useable. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. But we need to tighten 3 nuts. We have 4 spanners. So we can use 3 spanners. But we must ensure that each spanner is useable at the time of use. After use, useable becomes false. So we need to use 3 spanners.
We also must satisfy constraint: at-most
