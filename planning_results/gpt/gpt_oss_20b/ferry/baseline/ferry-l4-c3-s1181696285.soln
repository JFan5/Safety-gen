analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. Cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l2, at c2 l2. at-ferry l2. So ferry starts at l2.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0)
So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the ferry is at l1 when c0 reaches l3, and at some point before the goal, ferry is at l0 when c2 reaches l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions:
- sail: from ?from to ?to, requires not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
- board: requires car ?car, location ?loc, at ?car ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
- debark: requires car ?car, location ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l1.
We need to move cars to target locations. Initially c0 at l0, c1 at l2, c2 at l2. Ferry at l2.
We need to get c0 to l3, c1 stays at l2, c2 to l1.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before goal, ferry at l1 when c0 at l3. So we need to have ferry at l1 before c0 reaches l3. Similarly, at some point before goal, ferry at l0
