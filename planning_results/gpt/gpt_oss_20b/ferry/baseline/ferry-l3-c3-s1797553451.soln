analysisWe need to produce a plan for the ferry problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry domain with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2 exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq relations between locations. empty-ferry true. at c0 l2, at c1 l2, at c2 l1. at-ferry l1.
Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l0, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l1, and ferry must be at l1 before c1 reaches l0. So we need to schedule ferry movements accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
Let's think of a plan.
We have initial ferry at l1. We need to get c0 to l1, c1 to l0, c2 to l1 (already at l1). c2 already at l1, so fine.
We need to move c0 from l2 to l1. c1 from l2 to l0. c2 stays at l1.
We need ferry to be at l0 before c0 reaches l1. That means ferry must travel to l0 before c0 gets to l1. But ferry starts at l1. So we need to sail to l0 first, then board c0 at l2? Wait c0 is at l2. Ferry at l1. To get c0 to l1, we need ferry to go to l2, board c0, sail to l1. But constraint says ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l1. So we need ferry to go to l0 before c0 gets to l1. But ferry is at l1 initially. So we need to sail to l0 first, then later to l2 to board c0, then sail to l1. But we also need ferry to be at l1 before c1 reaches l0. That means ferry must be at l1 before c1 gets to l0. But ferry will be at l1 after delivering c0?
