analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l5, at c1 l1, at c2 l3. at-ferry l4.
Goal: at c0 l5, at c1 l1, at c2 l5. So we need to move c2 from l3 to l5. Also ensure constraints: sometime-before (at c2 l5) (at-ferry l0). Means at some point before the goal, at-ferry l0 must have been true. So the ferry must have visited l0 before c2 reaches l5. But the goal requires at c2 l5. So we need to plan such that at some point before reaching that, ferry at l0. The ferry starts at l4. So we need to sail to l0 at some point before final state.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider actions:
- sail: from ?from to ?to. Preconditions: not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
- board: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, at ?car ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
- debark: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
Goal: at c0 l5 (already true), at c1 l1 (already true), at c2 l5 (needs to be achieved). So we need to move c2 from l3 to l5.
We also need to satisfy constraint: at some point before (at c2 l5) (at-ferry l0). So we need to have ferry at l0 before final state.
We can plan: ferry starts at
