analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l1, at c2 l2. at-ferry l3. So ferry starts at l3.
Goal: all cars at l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l0) (at-ferry l1)
So each car must reach l0 before ferry reaches certain location? Wait constraints: "sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1)" means that the event of car c0 at l0 must occur before the event of ferry at l1. Similarly for c1 at l0 before ferry at l2, and c2 at l0 before ferry at l1. So ferry must reach l1 after all cars at l0? Actually constraints require that at-ferry l1 occurs after at c0 l0 and at c2 l0. So ferry must not reach l1 until after those cars are at l0. Similarly ferry must not reach l2 until after c1 at l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move all cars to l0. Ferry starts at l3. It can sail to other locations. It can board cars onto ferry when at same location and ferry empty. Then debark at destination.
Goal: all cars at l0. So we need to bring each car to l0.
We need to ensure that ferry reaches l1 after c0 and c2 at l0. So we cannot sail to l1 until after those cars are at l0. Similarly ferry must reach l2 after c1 at l0.
We can plan: ferry goes to l0, bring cars there. But ferry must not reach l1 until after c0 and c2 at l0. So we can have ferry go to l0, bring cars there, then go to l1
