analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given domain and problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Action sail: parameters ?from ?to. Preconditions: not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
Action board: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, at ?car ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
Action debark: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
Problem: objects l0 l1 l2 l3, c0 c1 c2.
Init: location l0, l1, l2, l3. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry. at c0 l2, at c1 l2, at c2 l0. at-ferry l3.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l3, and ferry must be at l1 before c2 reaches l2. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and constraints.
We need to consider that at start, ferry at l3. At start, c0 at l2, c1 at l2, c2 at l0.
Goal: c0 at l2 (already), c1 at l3, c2 at l2.
So we need to move c1 from l2 to l3, and c2 from l0 to l2.
We need to use ferry to transport cars. The ferry can carry one car at a time? The board action requires empty-ferry. So ferry can carry one car at
