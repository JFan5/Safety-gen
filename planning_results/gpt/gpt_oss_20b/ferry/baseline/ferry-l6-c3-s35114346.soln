analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain with constraints. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all present. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (ensures all distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l0, at c2 l0. at-ferry l1.
Goal: at c0 l4, at c1 l3, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l4) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l2)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l4; ferry must be at l2 before c1 reaches l3; ferry must be at l2 before c2 reaches l1. So ferry must be at l2 before both c1 and c2 reach their target locations. Also ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l4.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions: board: requires car at location, at-ferry at that location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, at-ferry remains same location, empty-ferry false.
Debark: requires car on ferry, at-ferry at location, location exists. After debark, car at location, empty-ferry true.
Sail: requires at-ferry at from, location at from and to, not-eq from to. After sail, at-ferry at to, not at-ferry at from.
We need to move cars to goal locations.
Initial: at c0 l3, at c1 l0, at c2 l0, at-ferry l1, empty-ferry true.
Goal: at c0 l4, at c1 l3, at c2 l1.
We need to plan sequence.
We need to satisfy constraints: ferry must be at l2 before c1 and c2 reach their goal locations. So ferry must sail to l2 before we debark c1 and c2 at l3 and l1 respectively
