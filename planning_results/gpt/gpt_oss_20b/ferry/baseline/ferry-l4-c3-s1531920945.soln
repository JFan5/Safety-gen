analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. Cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l3. at-ferry l3. So ferry starts at l3.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l1 before c0 reaches l2; ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l3; ferry must be at l1 before c2 reaches l0. So we need to schedule ferry movements accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions:
- sail: from ?from to ?to, precondition: not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
- board: car ?car at ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
- debark: car ?car at ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
We need to move cars to target locations.
Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l3, c2 at l0.
We start with c0 at l0, c1 at l1, c2 at l3. Ferry at l3.
We need to get c0 to l2, c1 to l3, c2 to l0.
We need to satisfy constraints: at c0 l2 must happen before ferry at l1. So ferry must be at l1 before c0 reaches l2. Similarly,
