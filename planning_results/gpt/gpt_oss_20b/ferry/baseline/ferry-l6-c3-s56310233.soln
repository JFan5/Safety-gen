analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0-l5 all exist. Cars c0, c1, c2. At initial: c0 at l2, c1 at l0, c2 at l3. Ferry at l5. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l5. at c0 l2, at c1 l0, at c2 l3. at-ferry l5. empty-ferry true.
Goal: at c0 l4, at c1 l1, at c2 l3. So we need to move c0 to l4, c1 to l1, c2 stays at l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l4) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l4, and ferry must be at l2 before c1 reaches l1. So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the ferry is at l0 and l2 respectively.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move cars to target locations. The ferry can carry one car at a time? The board action requires empty-ferry and at-ferry at location. So ferry must be at location of car to board. Then ferry can sail to another location, then debark.
We need to get c0 to l4, c1 to l1, c2 stays at l3.
We need to ensure ferry at l0 before c0 at l4. So ferry must travel to l0 before moving c0 to l4. Similarly ferry at l2 before c1 at l1.
We can plan: ferry starts at l5. We can sail to l0, board c1 at l0, sail to l1, debark c1 at l1. That satisfies constraint for c1. Then ferry can sail to l2, board c0 at l2, sail to l4, debark c0 at l4. That satisfies constraint for c0. Meanwhile c2 stays at l3.
But we need to ensure ferry at l0 before c0
