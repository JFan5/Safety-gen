analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain with constraints. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all present. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (ensures distinctness). empty-ferry true. at c0 l2, at c1 l4, at c2 l0. at-ferry l4. So ferry starts at l4.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l4.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l2) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l4) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: For each pair, the event of car at target location must happen before the ferry reaches that location. So the ferry must reach l0 before c0 at l3 and c1 at l2. And ferry must reach l1 before c2 at l4.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions: board: requires car at location, ferry at location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, at location removed, ferry still at same location, empty-ferry false. Debark: requires car on ferry, ferry at location, after debark car at location, ferry empty-ferry true.
Sail: requires ferry at from, location from and to, not-eq from to. After sail, ferry at to, not at from.
We need to move cars to goal locations.
Goal: c0 at l3, c1 at l2, c2 at l4.
Initial positions: c0 at l2, c1 at l4, c2 at l0. Ferry at l4.
We need to move each car to target.
We need to satisfy constraints: at c0 l3 before ferry at l0; at c1 l2 before ferry at l0; at c2 l4 before ferry at l1.
Thus ferry must reach l0 before c0 and c1 reach their goals. Ferry must reach l1 before c2 reaches l4.
We can plan: ferry starts at
