analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all present. Cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (makes them distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l0, at c2 l4. at-ferry l1. So ferry starts at l1.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l4, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l4) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0)
So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the ferry is at l0 when c0 is at l2; at some point before the goal, ferry at l2 when c1 at l4; and at some point before the goal, ferry at l0 when c2 at l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the actions: board: requires car at location, ferry at location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, ferry still at same location, empty-ferry false. Debark: requires car on ferry, ferry at location, after debark car at location, ferry empty again.
Sail: requires ferry at from, not-eq from to, location from and to. After sail, ferry at to.
We need to move cars to goal locations: c0 to l2, c1 to l4, c2 to l1.
We start with c0 at l3, c1 at l0, c2 at l4. Ferry at l1.
Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l4, c2 at l1.
We need to plan ferry movements and board/debark actions.
We also need to satisfy constraints: at some point before goal, ferry at l0 when c0 at l2; at some point before goal, ferry at l2 when c1 at l4; at some point before goal, ferry at l0 when c2 at l1
