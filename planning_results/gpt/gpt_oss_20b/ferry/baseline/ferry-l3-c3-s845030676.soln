analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs: all distinct. empty-ferry true. at c0 l2, at c1 l1, at c2 l1. at-ferry l1.
Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l1, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l0)
So ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l1 and before c2 reaches l2. That means ferry must visit l0 before those events. But ferry starts at l1. So we need to sail to l0 before those events happen.
We need to plan actions to move cars to goal locations.
We have 3 cars: c0 at l2, c1 at l1, c2 at l1. Goal: c0 at l1, c1 at l1, c2 at l2.
So we need to move c0 from l2 to l1, and c2 from l1 to l2. c1 stays at l1.
We need to use ferry to transport cars between locations.
We need to satisfy constraints: at-ferry l0 must happen before at c0 l1 and at c2 l2. So ferry must sail to l0 before those events.
We can plan: ferry at l1 initially. We can sail to l0, then board cars, etc.
But we need to ensure that at c0 l1 occurs after ferry at l0. Similarly at c2 l2 after ferry at l0.
We can do: sail from l1 to l0. Then board c0 at l2? Wait c0 is at l2, not at l0. So we need to bring ferry to l2 to board c0. But ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l1. So we need to bring ferry to l0 first, then later bring ferry to l2 to board c0, then sail to l1 to drop c0. But constraint
