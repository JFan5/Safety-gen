analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem with constraints. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (makes them distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l5, at c1 l2, at c2 l4. at-ferry l2. So ferry starts at l2.
Goal: at c0 l0, at c1 l5, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l5) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0)
Interpretation: The action at-ferry l1 must occur before the car at c0 reaches l0. Similarly, at-ferry l0 must occur before c1 at l5 and c2 at l1. So ferry must visit l1 before c0 reaches l0, and must visit l0 before c1 and c2 reach their goals.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that ferry can sail between locations, board cars onto ferry, debark them.
We need to get each car to its goal location.
Goal: c0 at l0, c1 at l5, c2 at l1.
We need to ensure that at-ferry l1 occurs before c0 at l0. So ferry must visit l1 before c0 reaches l0. Similarly, ferry must visit l0 before c1 and c2 reach their goals.
We can plan: ferry starts at l2. It can sail to l1, board c1? Wait c1 is at l2 initially. Actually c1 at l2. So ferry at l2 can board c1. But we need to get c1 to l5. But constraint says at-ferry l0 must occur before c1 at l5. So ferry must visit l0 before c1 reaches l5. So we can have ferry sail to l0, then debark c1 at l0? But goal is c1 at l5. So we need to eventually get c1 to
