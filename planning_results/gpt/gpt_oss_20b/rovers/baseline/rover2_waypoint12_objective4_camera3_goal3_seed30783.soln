analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. The goal: communicate soil data at waypoint2,8,4; communicate rock data at waypoint0,1,11,9; communicate image data objective3 high_res and objective1 low_res. Constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We must ensure all preconditions satisfied. We can choose any plan that works.
We need to consider the actions available: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint8 initially, rover1 at waypoint11. They have stores: rover0store, rover1store. They are equipped for soil analysis, imaging, etc. Rover1 also equipped for rock analysis.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 2,8,4. They are at those waypoints initially? Let's check init: at_soil_sample waypoint0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9. So soil samples at those waypoints. For waypoint2, we need to communicate soil data. So we need to sample soil at waypoint2, then communicate. Similarly for 8 and 4.
Also rock samples at 0,1,9,11. They are at those waypoints initially. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints and communicate.
Also need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective1 low_res. We need to calibrate cameras and take images.
We need to ensure that after sampling, we drop the sample into store, then communicate.
We need to ensure that the rovers can traverse to those waypoints. They have can_traverse edges. We need to navigate accordingly.
We need to ensure that the rovers are available and channel_free for communication.
We need to ensure that the constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously. Initially rover0 at 8, rover1 at 11. So fine.
We need to produce a plan. Let's design a plan.
We have two rovers. Let's decide to use rover0 to handle soil samples at 2,8,4. Rover1 to handle rock samples at 0,1,9,11 and image
