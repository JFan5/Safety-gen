analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. We have to satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint7). Means rover must visit waypoint4 before waypoint7? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint4 must happen before at rover0 waypoint7. So we need to ensure that in plan, the rover visits waypoint4 before waypoint7. Also we need to eventually communicate image data for objective0 low_res. That requires have_image rover0 objective0 low_res, and then communicate_image_data action.
We need to get have_image. To get have_image, we need to calibrate camera, then take_image. The camera must be on board, calibrated, supports low_res, visible_from objective0 at some waypoint where rover is. The visible_from objective0 includes waypoint1,4,7. So we need to be at a waypoint that is visible from objective0. Also we need to have visible_from objective0 at that waypoint. The visible_from predicate is defined for objective0 at waypoint1,4,7. So we need to be at one of those waypoints. Also we need to have visible_from objective0 at that waypoint. The visible_from predicate is static; we don't need to satisfy visible? Wait visible_from is a predicate that indicates that objective0 can see that waypoint. So we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. So we can be at waypoint4 or 1 or 7. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at rover0 waypoint4 before at rover0 waypoint7. So we can go to waypoint4 first, then to waypoint7. But we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. Let's choose waypoint4. So we can navigate to waypoint4, calibrate camera0 (or camera1) for objective0, then take image low_res, then communicate image data.
We also need to ensure that we have the camera calibrated. The calibrate action requires: equipped_for_imaging rover, calibration_target camera i objective t, at rover w, visible_from t w, on_board camera i. So we need to be at a waypoint w that is visible_from objective0. So we can be at waypoint4. visible_from objective0 waypoint4 is true. So calibrate camera0 at waypoint4. Then take_image at waypoint4 with camera0, low_res. Then communicate_image_data at waypoint4 to lander general. But we need to be
