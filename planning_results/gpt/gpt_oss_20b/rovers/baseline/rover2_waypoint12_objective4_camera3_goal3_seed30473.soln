analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. The goal: communicate soil data at waypoint2 and 9, rock data at 5,9,2,6, image data for objective0 and 1 colour. Constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 2,10,9 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies all goals. We need to consider actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold. We need to produce a sequence of actions that leads to the goal.
We need to consider that each rover has a store. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints where samples exist. They need to have the sample in store to communicate. They need to have the sample in store to drop. They need to have the sample in store to communicate. They need to have the sample in store to communicate.
