analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint5 and communicated_image_data objective2 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means at some point, rover0 at waypoint6 must occur before at some point rover0 at waypoint0. So we need to ensure that at some point we visit waypoint6 before we visit waypoint0. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint2. So we need to plan a sequence that visits waypoint6 before waypoint0. Also we need to communicate rock data at waypoint5 and image data objective2 colour. We have to sample rock at waypoint5? Actually at_rock_sample waypoint5 is true initially. So we need to sample rock at waypoint5, then communicate rock data. Also we need to take image of objective2 with colour mode. We need to calibrate camera0 or camera1? We have camera0 supports colour, high_res. camera1 supports colour, low_res. We need to take image with colour mode. So we need to calibrate camera0 or camera1 for objective2. We have calibration_target camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1. So cameras are calibrated for objective1 only. But we need to take image of objective2. We can calibrate camera for objective2? The calibrate action requires calibration_target ?i ?t. So we cannot calibrate for objective2 because not defined. But we could use camera that supports colour and take image of objective2. But precondition requires calibrated ?i ?r. So we need to calibrate camera for objective2. But calibration_target only defined for objective1. So maybe we can calibrate for objective2 by using calibration_target? Wait: calibration_target predicate indicates which objective a camera is calibrated for. In init, we have calibration_target camera0 objective1 and camera1 objective1. So only objective1. So we cannot calibrate for objective2. But maybe we can take image without calibration? No, precondition requires calibrated. So we need to calibrate for objective2. But we don't have that. Maybe we can use camera1? It supports colour. But still calibration_target only objective1. So we cannot calibrate for objective2. But maybe we can take image without calibration? The precondition: (calibrated ?i ?r
