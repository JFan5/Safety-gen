analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_image_data objective3 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint2 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint2 before it is at waypoint8. So we need to schedule visits accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
Goal: communicate image data for objective3 high_res, objective1 high_res, objective3 low_res. So we need to take images for those objectives and then communicate them.
We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res. camera2 supports colour and high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective0, camera1 objective0, camera2 objective1. So camera2 is calibrated for objective1. camera0 and camera1 for objective0. But we need images for objective3 and objective1. Wait objective3 is visible from many waypoints: 0,1,2,4,7,8,9,11. So we need to take images for objective3 high_res and low_res. But camera0 supports high_res and low_res. So we can use camera0 to take images for objective3. But camera0 is calibrated for objective0, not objective3. Calibration target is camera0 objective0. But we can calibrate camera0 for objective0 only. But we need to take images for objective3. The calibrate action requires calibration_target camera0 objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera0 for objective3. But we can calibrate camera0 for objective0 only. But we need to take images for objective3. But the calibrate action only allows calibrating for the target objective. So we cannot calibrate camera0 for objective3. But we can use camera2? camera2 supports high_res and colour. But camera2 is calibrated for objective1. So we can take images for objective1 with camera2. But we need objective3 images. We could use camera1? camera1 supports high_res. But camera
