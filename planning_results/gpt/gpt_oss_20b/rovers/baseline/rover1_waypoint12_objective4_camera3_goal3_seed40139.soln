analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective1 high_res and objective0 high_res. We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res and low_res. camera2 supports colour. But goal requires high_res for objective1 and objective0. So we need to calibrate cameras for those objectives and take images, then communicate image data.
We need to satisfy constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint9) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint9 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint9 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So we must ensure that in plan, we visit waypoint9 before waypoint8.
We start at waypoint11. We need to navigate to waypoint9 then to waypoint8. Also need to capture images for objective1 and objective0. objective1 visible_from waypoint9 and 10 and 11. objective0 visible_from waypoint5,9,11. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the objective. For objective1, we can be at waypoint9,10,11. For objective0, we can be at waypoint5,9,11. So we can take images at waypoint9 for both objectives? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint9, so yes. So we can take image of objective0 at waypoint9. For objective1, visible_from waypoint9 as well. So we can take both images at waypoint9. But we need to calibrate cameras for each objective. We have calibration_target camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective3. So camera0 calibrates for objective0, camera1 for objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 and camera1 at waypoint9. Then take images with each camera. Then communicate image data via lander general at waypoint10? Wait communicate_image_data action requires at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_image, visible, available, channel_free. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to lander. Lander at waypoint10. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint10. Many visible pairs: visible waypoint10 waypoint0,1,3,4,5,8,9, etc. So we can be at waypoint10 to communicate. But we need to satisfy constraint: at rover0 waypoint9 before at rover0 waypoint8. So we can go to waypoint9, then
