analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data for waypoint8,4,11,0; communicated_image_data for objective0 low_res, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour, objective3 high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint10). Means rover must visit waypoint4 before waypoint10? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint10). So at some point, rover at waypoint4 before at waypoint10. So we need to ensure that order.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves all goals. We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint4. So at start, at waypoint4. So constraint satisfied: at start at waypoint4 before at waypoint10? But we need to ensure that at some point we visit waypoint10 after that. So we can just go to waypoint10 later.
We need to collect rock samples at waypoint8,4,11,0. They are at those waypoints. We need to sample rock at each waypoint, then communicate rock data to lander general. The communicate action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at waypoint11, have_rock_analysis at that waypoint, visible between rover and lander, available rover, channel_free. After communication, channel_free toggles? The effect: not (available ?r) and not (channel_free ?l) then channel_free ?l again? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: they set channel_free to false then true again? Actually they set not channel_free then channel_free again. So net effect: channel_free remains true. So no effect on channel_free. But they set not available. Then they set available again. So net effect: available remains true. So communication doesn't change anything? But they set not available then available again. So no effect. So we can communicate at any time.
We need to have have_rock_analysis at each waypoint. That requires sample_rock action at that waypoint. sample_rock requires at rover at that waypoint, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of store, empty store. So we need to sample rock at each waypoint. After sampling, store becomes full. Then drop to empty store. Then we can communicate.
We also need to have image data for objectives. For each objective, we
