analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint9,7,11,2; communicated_rock_data for waypoint10,9,11; communicated_image_data for objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. Rover0 has soil analysis equipment, rover1 has soil, rock, imaging. Rover0 store empty, rover1 store empty. They can traverse many waypoints.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 9,7,11,2. They are at those waypoints initially. We need to sample soil and communicate data. For each sample, we need to have have_soil_analysis after sample. Then communicate_soil_data action requires have_soil_analysis and visible from lander. Lander general at waypoint1. So we need to get rover to waypoint1? Wait visible_from objective0 etc. But for communicate_soil_data, preconditions: at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_soil_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to lander. Lander at waypoint1. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint1. Many waypoints visible to waypoint1: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. So we can be at any of those. So we can sample soil at waypoint9,7,11,2. Then communicate.
Similarly rock data for waypoint10,9,11. We need have_rock_analysis at those waypoints. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints. We have rock samples at 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11. So we can sample rock at 10,9,11.
Also need image data for objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res. We need to take images at those objectives with appropriate camera and mode. We have cameras 0,1,2 with supports. Camera0 supports high_res and low_res. Camera1 supports high_res and low_res. Camera2 supports colour, high_res. We need objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res. We need to calibrate camera to objective. For objective2, calibration_target camera2 objective2. For objective3, calibration_target camera0 objective3. So we need
