analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint2, communicated_rock_data waypoint10, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint6? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6). So at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint1 before it is at waypoint6. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint1 before it reaches waypoint6. It doesn't require that it visits both; but must satisfy that at some point, at waypoint1 occurs before at waypoint6. So we need to schedule visits accordingly.
We need to achieve communicated_rock_data for waypoint2 and waypoint10. That requires having rock analysis at those waypoints, then communicating. Also need communicated_image_data for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res. That requires having images for those objectives with respective modes.
We have cameras: camera0 supports low_res, camera1 supports high_res, camera2 supports high_res and low_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So to take image for objective0, we need a camera that supports high_res? Wait objective0 visible_from includes waypoint0,1,2,4,7,8. So to take image for objective0 high_res, we need a camera that supports high_res. camera1 supports high_res, camera2 supports high_res. So we can use camera1 or camera2. But camera1 calibration target is objective1, not objective0. Calibration target indicates which objective the camera is calibrated for. But calibration action calibrates camera for a target objective. So to take image for objective0, we need to calibrate camera for objective0. But we only have calibration_target for camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective0. Wait maybe calibration_target indicates that camera can be calibrated for that objective. But we only have those three. So we cannot calibrate for objective0. But maybe we can calibrate for objective1 and then take image for objective0? That seems wrong. The calibration action requires calibration_target ?i ?t. So only cameras with calibration_target for objective0 can be calibrated. None. So maybe we cannot take image for
