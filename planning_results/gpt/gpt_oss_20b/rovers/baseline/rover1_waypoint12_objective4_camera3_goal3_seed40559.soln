analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,9,6,4; communicated_image_data for objective1 low_res and objective0 low_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint7). So rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint7.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these goals. We must consider actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint0. There are visible relations between waypoints. We need to traverse to waypoints with samples: waypoint2,6,4,9. They have at_soil_sample or at_rock_sample. For soil samples: waypoint2,4,5,6,8,9. For rock samples: waypoint0,4,6,7,8,9,10. We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,6,4. For each, we need to sample soil (sample_soil action). That requires at_soil_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store empty, etc. After sampling, we need to communicate soil data to lander general. The communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at some waypoint, have_soil_analysis, visible, available, channel_free. After communicating, the channel_free toggles? The effect: not (available ?r) then not (channel_free ?l) then channel_free ?l? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: first not channel_free, then channel_free. So net effect: channel_free remains true? Actually effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). So channel_free is set to true again. So channel_free remains true. So we can communicate multiple times.
We need to ensure that after each communicate, the rover becomes unavailable? Actually available toggles: initially available rover0. After communicate, available becomes false, then set back to true. So fine.
We need to ensure that we have soil analysis at each waypoint. So we need to sample soil at each waypoint. For each sample, we need to have store empty. After sample, store becomes full. Then drop
