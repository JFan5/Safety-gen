analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint2 and communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must visit waypoint5 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint5 must happen before at rover0 waypoint0. So sequence must have at waypoint5 before at waypoint0.
We need to get soil sample at waypoint2, then communicate soil data. Also need to take image of objective0 low_res and communicate image data.
We have camera0 supports colour and low_res. We need to calibrate camera0 for objective0. Then take image at some waypoint visible from objective0. visible_from objective0 includes waypoint0,2,3,5. So we can take image at waypoint5 (since at rover0 waypoint5 initially). But we need to be at a waypoint that is visible from objective0. At waypoint5, visible_from objective0 includes waypoint5. So we can take image at waypoint5. But we need to be at waypoint5 and camera0 on board, calibrated for objective0. So steps: calibrate camera0 at waypoint5 for objective0. Then take image at waypoint5 with camera0 low_res. Then communicate image data to lander general.
Also need to communicate soil data from waypoint2. We need to have soil sample at waypoint2. Initially at waypoint2 there is at_soil_sample. So we need to sample soil at waypoint2. But we need to be at waypoint2. We can navigate from waypoint5 to waypoint2. But we must satisfy constraint: at rover0 waypoint5 before at rover0 waypoint0. So we can navigate to waypoint2, sample soil, then navigate to waypoint0? Wait we need to communicate soil data from waypoint2. So we need to be at waypoint2 to sample soil. After sampling, we need to communicate soil data to lander general. We need to be at a waypoint visible from lander general. Lander is at waypoint3. visible_from? We have visible relations: visible waypoint3 waypoint4, etc. But we need visible between waypoint2 and waypoint3? visible waypoint2 waypoint3? Not listed. visible relations: visible waypoint2 waypoint1, visible waypoint2 waypoint0, visible waypoint2 waypoint5, visible waypoint2 waypoint4. No visible to waypoint3. So cannot communicate from waypoint2 to lander at waypoint3 because not visible. But we can navigate to waypoint
