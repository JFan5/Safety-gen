analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint6, waypoint7, communicated_rock_data waypoint8,1,4, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res, low_res, objective2 colour.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They have equipment: rover0 has equipped_for_rock_analysis, imaging; rover1 has equipped_for_soil_analysis, imaging. They each have stores. They start at waypoint8. They can traverse to various waypoints. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints with samples. They can communicate data to lander general. They need to have data for soil samples at waypoint6 and 7. Also rock data at 8,1,4. Also images for objective1 high_res, low_res, objective2 colour.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate.
We need to ensure that at each step preconditions hold.
We also have constraint: never both rovers at waypoint8 simultaneously. They start at waypoint8. So we must move one away before the other moves? Actually constraint: always not (and (at rover0 waypoint8) (at rover1 waypoint8)). So they cannot both be at waypoint8 at same time. They start both at waypoint8. That violates constraint. So we need to adjust: maybe we need to move one rover out of waypoint8 before the other moves. But they start at waypoint8. The constraint is always, so at initial state it's violated. But maybe the constraint is not enforced at initial state? It says always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint8) (at rover1 waypoint8))). So at initial state, both are at waypoint8, violating. So the problem is unsolvable? But maybe the constraint is not enforced at initial state? Usually constraints apply to all states, including initial. So unsolvable. But maybe we can move one rover out before the other moves. But they start both at waypoint8. So we need to move one rover away first. But we cannot because they both start at waypoint8. But we can move one rover to another waypoint, then the other can stay. But the constraint says at any time, they cannot both be at waypoint8. So we can move rover0 to waypoint1, for example. Then rover1 stays at waypoint8. That satisfies constraint. Then we can move rover1 to other waypoints. So plan
