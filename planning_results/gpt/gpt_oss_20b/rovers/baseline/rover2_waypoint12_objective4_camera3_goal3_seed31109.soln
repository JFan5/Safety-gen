analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, samples, etc. The goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint11, waypoint10, waypoint6; communicated_rock_data for waypoint11, waypoint4; communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and objective0 colour.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these goals while respecting constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0,2,1 simultaneously. Also must satisfy preconditions.
We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. Rover0 has equipment for soil and rock analysis. Rover1 has equipment for rock analysis and imaging. Rover0 has store rover0store, empty initially. Rover1 has store rover1store, empty.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoint3,6,10,11? Wait initial state: at_soil_sample at waypoint3,6,10,11. Also at_rock_sample at waypoint0,3,4,7,8,9,10,11. So we need to collect soil samples at 3,6,10,11. But goal only requires communicated_soil_data for waypoint11,10,6. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints and communicate.
Also need rock data for waypoint11 and 4. So need to sample rock at those waypoints.
Also need images for objective2 colour and objective0 colour. Objective0 visible_from at waypoint0,2,3,4,6,8,9. Objective2 visible_from at 1,6,7,9. So we need to take images at those waypoints.
We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. Cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 calibration target objective0, supports high_res. camera1 target objective2, supports colour and high_res. camera2 target objective0, supports colour and low_res.
We need to take images for objective0 colour and objective2 colour. So we need to use camera1 for objective2 colour? Wait camera1 supports colour and high_res. So yes, camera1 can take colour images. For objective0 colour, we need camera2 (supports colour). So we need to calibrate camera2 for objective0,
