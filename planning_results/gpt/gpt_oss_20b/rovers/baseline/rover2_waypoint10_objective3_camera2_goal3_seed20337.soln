analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint6, communicated_soil_data waypoint9, communicated_rock_data waypoint9, communicated_rock_data waypoint0, communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 low_res.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They can traverse between waypoints. They have stores to store samples. They can sample soil and rock, drop, calibrate cameras, take images, communicate data to lander general.
We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.
We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 9 simultaneously.
We need to produce a valid plan. We can choose any plan that achieves the goal. Let's design a simple plan.
We need to communicate soil data from waypoint6 and 9. So we need to have rover at those waypoints, have soil analysis, then communicate.
Also rock data from 9,0,7. So need rock analysis at those waypoints.
Also image data for objective0 high_res and objective1 low_res.
We have cameras on each rover: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1. Calibration targets: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective0. So camera0 calibrates for objective1, camera1 for objective0.
We need to take images for objective0 high_res and objective1 low_res. So camera1 must take high_res image of objective0, camera0 must take low_res image of objective1.
We need to ensure visible_from conditions: objective0 visible_from waypoint0,5,6,7. objective1 visible_from waypoint0,2,4,5,9. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the objective.
Also visible_from is used in calibrate and take_image actions: calibrate requires visible_from target and at rover's current waypoint. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the target objective.
Also take_image requires visible_from objective to waypoint, at rover at that waypoint, and camera on board, calibrated, supports mode, etc.
We also need to ensure that after taking image, the camera is no longer calibrated (calibrated predicate removed). So we need to calibrate before each image.
Also we need to ensure that the camera is on board and supports the mode.
We also need to ensure that the rover has the camera on board: on_board camera0 rover0
