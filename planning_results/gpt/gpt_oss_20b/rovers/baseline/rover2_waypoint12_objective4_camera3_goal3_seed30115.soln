analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint8, communicated_rock_data waypoint9, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint1 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint1 respectively. They have equipment: rover0 equipped for imaging, rover1 equipped for rock analysis and imaging. They have stores empty.
Goal: need to communicate rock data for waypoint8 and waypoint9. That requires have_rock_analysis at those waypoints, then communicate_rock_data action. Also need to communicate image data for objective0 and objective3 high_res. That requires have_image for those objectives with high_res mode.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_rock, sample_soil, calibrate, take_image, communicate_*.
We need to ensure that at each step preconditions hold.
We need to produce a valid plan. We can choose a simple plan: rover0 collects rock samples at waypoint8 and 9, then communicates. Also rover0 or rover1 takes images for objective0 and objective3.
But we must consider that objective0 visible_from waypoint0,1,2,5,9,11. So to take image for objective0, we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. For objective3 visible_from waypoint0. So we need to be at waypoint0 to take image for objective3. For objective0 we can be at any visible waypoint.
Also we need to calibrate camera before taking image. We have cameras on rovers: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. They have calibration targets: camera0 and camera1 target objective3, camera2 target objective3. So all cameras target objective3. But we need images for objective0 and objective3. So we need to calibrate camera for objective0? Wait calibration_target is only for objective3. So cameras cannot be calibrated for objective0. But we can still take image for objective0? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r) and (on_board ?i ?r) and (supports ?i ?m) and (visible_from ?o ?p) and (at ?r ?p). So we need calibrated camera for the rover. But calibration is only for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective
