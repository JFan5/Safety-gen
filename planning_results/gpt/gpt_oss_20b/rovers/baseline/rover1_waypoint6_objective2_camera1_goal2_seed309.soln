analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint5, communicated_image_data objective1 colour, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must be at waypoint5 before at waypoint0? Wait "sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0)" means that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint0. So the plan must have rover at waypoint5 before it goes to waypoint0. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. So constraint satisfied? The constraint says at some point, at waypoint5 before at waypoint0. Since initial state is at waypoint5, that satisfies. So we don't need to move to waypoint0 after that? But we might need to move to waypoint0 to do something? But we need to communicate data from waypoint5 (rock sample). We need to have have_rock_analysis at waypoint5. Initially at waypoint5 there is at_rock_sample waypoint5. So we need to sample rock at waypoint5. Also we need to have image data for objective1 colour and high_res. For that we need to take images at objective1. objective1 visible_from waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to take image? Wait visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So to take image of objective1, we need to be at waypoint4? Actually visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So if we are at waypoint4, we can take image of objective1. But we need to calibrate camera for objective1. The camera0 calibration target is objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 at some waypoint where objective1 is visible. That is visible_from objective1 waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to calibrate camera0 for objective1. Then we can take image at objective1 with camera0. But we also need to have the camera on board, which is true. We also need to have camera0 equipped for imaging. Yes. So plan: navigate to waypoint4, calibrate camera0 for objective1, take image objective1 high_res and colour. Then communicate image data to lander general. Also need to sample rock at waypoint5, communicate rock data. Also need to sample soil at waypoint1? Not necessary
