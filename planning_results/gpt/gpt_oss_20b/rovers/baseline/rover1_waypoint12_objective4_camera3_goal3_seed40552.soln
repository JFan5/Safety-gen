analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint5, 11, 1; communicated_rock_data for waypoint1,3,0; communicated_image_data for objective1 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint9) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must visit waypoint9 before waypoint2? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint9 must happen before at rover0 waypoint2. So sequence must have at waypoint9 before at waypoint2.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data. Also drop to empty store.
We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint1. It has empty store. It can traverse to many waypoints. We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 5, 11, 1. Wait soil samples exist at waypoint1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Actually at_soil_sample at waypoint1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at waypoint5, 11, 1. For each, we need to sample soil, then communicate soil data. For rock samples: at_rock_sample at waypoint0,1,2,3,6,7,8. We need rock data for waypoint0,1,3. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.
Also need to take images for objectives: objective1 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 colour. Each objective has calibration targets: camera0 -> objective2, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective0. But we need images for objective1 and objective0. Wait objective1 is visible_from at waypoint6,7,8. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective1. For objective0 visible_from at waypoint6,8,11. So we need to take images for objective1 low_res and objective1 colour, and objective0 colour. We have cameras that support modes: camera0 supports colour, low_res; camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res; camera2 supports colour. So we can take images with camera0 or camera1 or camera2. But we need to calibrate each camera for the target objective. For camera0
