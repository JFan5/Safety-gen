analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint8, 11, 0, 6; communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. Also constraint: always (not (at rover1 waypoint8)). So rover1 must never be at waypoint8. We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint3 initially, rover1 at waypoint9. We have visible relations, can_traverse edges. We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 8, 11, 0, 6. They are at those waypoints initially: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Wait list: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Also at_rock_sample at 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at 8, 11, 0, 6. We have store for each rover. They start empty. We need to sample soil at each waypoint, then communicate soil data to lander general at waypoint2. The lander is at waypoint2. We need to have rover at waypoint2 to communicate. But we have to ensure that rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. But rover0 can traverse to waypoint8? Let's check can_traverse edges: rover0 can traverse to waypoint8 from 3, and from 8 to 4, 10. Also from 3 to 9, 11. So to reach waypoint8, rover0 must go from 3 to 8. That's allowed. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. For other waypoints 0,6,11, we can use rover0 or rover1. But we must ensure rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can avoid that.
Goal also requires communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. We need to take images at those objectives. We have cameras on rovers: camera0,1,2 on rover0; camera3 on rover1. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective2, camera2 -> objective2, camera3 -> objective1. They support modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res; camera1 supports low_res; camera
