analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated soil data for waypoint0 and waypoint10, communicated rock data for waypoint0,10,2,11, and communicated image data for objective2 low_res and objective1 low_res. We have two rovers, rover0 and rover1. They can traverse between waypoints. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They can sample soil/rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data. We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.
We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that respects these constraints.
We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint7, rover1 at waypoint5. They can traverse to other waypoints via can_traverse edges. They can sample soil/rock at waypoints that have samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint10. The lander is at waypoint10. The lander is channel_free initially. They can communicate data from rover to lander if visible and channel_free.
We need to achieve communicated data for waypoint0 and 10 for soil, rock, etc. Let's analyze.
Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint0, communicated_soil_data waypoint10, communicated_rock_data waypoint0,10,2,11, communicated_image_data objective2 low_res, objective1 low_res.
We need to produce a plan that collects soil and rock samples at those waypoints, then communicate them.
We also need to take images for objective2 low_res and objective1 low_res. The images must be taken by a rover at a waypoint that is visible from the objective. For objective2, visible_from objective2 includes waypoint1,3,4,9,10,11. For objective1, visible_from objective1 includes waypoint0,1,4,9. So we need to take images at those waypoints.
We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. The calibrate action requires that the camera is on board, calibration_target matches objective, at a waypoint visible from objective, and the rover is at that waypoint. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective3? Wait camera0 calibration_target is objective3. But we need images for objective2 and objective1. We have camera1 calibration_target objective0, camera2 calibration_target objective3. None of the cameras are calibration_target for objective2 or objective1. So we cannot
