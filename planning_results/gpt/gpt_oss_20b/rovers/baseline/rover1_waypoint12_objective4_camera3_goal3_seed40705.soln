analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover0 waypoint1). That means at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint0 before it is at waypoint1. So the plan must include visiting waypoint0 before waypoint1.
We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint3. We have visible relations. We need to get soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint3? Wait initial state: at_soil_sample waypoint2, at_rock_sample waypoint2, at_soil_sample waypoint3, at_rock_sample waypoint5, at_rock_sample waypoint7, at_rock_sample waypoint8. So soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint3. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and waypoint2. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints, then communicate.
We also need to capture images for objectives 2,1,3 with specified modes. We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res. camera2 supports colour, high_res, low_res. Calibration targets: camera0 -> objective3, camera1 -> objective0, camera2 -> objective0. So camera0 calibrates objective3. camera1 calibrates objective0. camera2 calibrates objective0. But we need images for objective2, objective1, objective3. We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. But camera0 calibrates objective3, camera1 objective0, camera2 objective0. None calibrate objective2 or objective1. But we can still take images with any camera? The calibrate action requires calibration_target camera i t. So only camera0 can calibrate objective3. But we need images for objective2 and objective1. We can still take images without calibration? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera for each objective. But we don't have calibration targets for objective2 or objective1. So maybe we can use camera2? It supports colour, high_res, low_res. But calibration_target only for camera2 is objective0. So cannot calibrate objective2 or objective1. So maybe we need to use camera0 for objective3 only. But we need images for objective2
