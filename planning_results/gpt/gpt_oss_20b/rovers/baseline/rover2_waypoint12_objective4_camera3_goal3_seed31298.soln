analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. The goal: communicate soil data for waypoint2,7,0; communicate rock data for waypoint10,11,9; communicate image data for objective2 colour, low_res, and objective0 colour.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these goals while respecting constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We need to ensure all preconditions hold at each step.
We need to consider the actions available: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint10 initially, rover1 at waypoint9. They have stores: rover0store, rover1store. They are equipped for soil, rock, imaging. They have cameras on board: camera0, camera1, camera2 on rover0; camera3 on rover1. Each camera has calibration targets: camera0 -> objective0, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective0, camera3 -> objective1. They support various modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res, low_res; camera1 supports low_res; camera2 supports colour; camera3 supports colour.
We need to get soil samples at waypoint2,7,0. They are at those waypoints initially? Let's check init: at_soil_sample waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint4, waypoint6, waypoint7. So soil samples at 0,2,4,6,7. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint2,7,0. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints and then communicate.
We also need rock samples at waypoint10,11,9. They are at rock samples at waypoint8,9,10,11. So rock samples at 8,9,10,11. We need to communicate rock data for 10,11,9. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.
We also need to take images for objective2 colour, low_res, and objective0 colour. We need to calibrate cameras for those objectives and then take images.
We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously
