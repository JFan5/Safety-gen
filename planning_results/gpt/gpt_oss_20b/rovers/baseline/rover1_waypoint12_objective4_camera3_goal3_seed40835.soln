analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint11, 0, 4; communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res. Also constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint1 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So order: at waypoint1 before at waypoint8. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint1. So constraint satisfied if we never go to waypoint8 before returning to waypoint1? Wait we start at waypoint1. So we need to ensure we don't go to waypoint8 before we are at waypoint1 again? But we start at waypoint1, so constraint satisfied. But if we go to waypoint8 later, we must have visited waypoint1 earlier. That's fine.
Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint11, 0, 4. We have soil samples at waypoint0,4,10,11. We need to sample soil at those waypoints and communicate. Also need to communicate image data for objective3 colour and objective1 low_res. We have cameras: camera0 supports low_res, camera1 supports colour, camera2 supports colour and high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective3, camera1 objective2, camera2 objective3. So to take image for objective3 colour, we need camera2 (supports colour) or camera1? camera1 supports colour but calibration target is objective2. So camera1 cannot take image for objective3. camera2 supports colour and calibration target objective3. So we need to calibrate camera2 at objective3, then take image at some waypoint visible from objective3. visible_from objective3: waypoint10,11. So we need to be at waypoint10 or 11 to take image. Also need to have camera2 on board, calibrated. So plan: navigate to waypoint10, calibrate camera2 at objective3, take image at waypoint10 with camera2, objective3, colour. That yields have_image for objective3 colour. Then communicate image data for objective3 colour. Similarly for objective1 low_res: camera0 supports low_res, calibration target objective3. Wait camera0 calibration target is objective3, not objective1. So cannot calibrate camera0 for objective1. But camera1 supports colour, calibration target objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective1. But we need image data for objective1 low_res. We need a camera that supports
