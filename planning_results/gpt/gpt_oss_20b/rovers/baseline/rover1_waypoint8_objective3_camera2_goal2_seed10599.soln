analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_soil_data waypoint4, communicated_image_data objective0 colour. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must visit waypoint5 before waypoint2? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint5 must happen before at rover0 waypoint2. So order: visit 5 before 2.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint7. We need to get soil samples at waypoint5 and 4. They are at waypoint5 and 4. We need to sample soil at those waypoints. Then communicate soil data to lander general. Also need to take image of objective0 with colour mode. objective0 visible from waypoint0,2,3,4. We need to be at a waypoint that can see objective0 and have camera calibrated for colour mode. We have camera1 supports colour and low_res. camera0 supports high_res. We need to calibrate camera1 for objective0. We have calibration_target camera1 objective2. Wait calibration_target is camera1 objective2. So camera1 can only calibrate for objective2. But we need to take image of objective0. But camera1 supports colour, but calibration_target is objective2. The calibrate action requires calibration_target ?i ?t. So we can only calibrate camera1 for objective2. But we need to take image of objective0. But calibrate action requires calibration_target. So we cannot calibrate camera1 for objective0. But we could calibrate camera0 for objective2? camera0 supports high_res. But we need colour mode. So maybe we need to use camera1 for colour mode. But we cannot calibrate it for objective0. But maybe we don't need calibration? The take_image action requires calibrated ?i ?r. So we need to calibrate camera1 for objective0. But calibration_target says camera1 objective2. So we cannot calibrate for objective0. So maybe we can use camera0? But camera0 supports high_res only. But we need colour mode. So maybe we can use camera1 for colour mode but we need to calibrate it for objective0. But the calibration_target is objective2. So we cannot calibr
