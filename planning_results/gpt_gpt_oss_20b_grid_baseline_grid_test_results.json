But we must ensure robot never at pos4-2. Let's examine connectivity: pos4-0 connects to pos5-0, pos4-1, pos3-0. pos4-1 connects to pos5-1, pos4-2, pos3-1. pos4-2 connects to pos5-2, pos4-3, pos3-2. So to go from pos4-0 to pos3-5, we need a path that doesn't go through pos4-2. Let's find a path: pos4-0 -> pos3-0 -> pos3-1 -> pos3-2 -> pos3-3 -> pos3-4 -> pos3-5? But check connections: pos3-0 connects to pos4-0, pos3-1, pos2-0. pos3-1 connects to pos4-1, pos3-2, pos2-1. pos3-2 connects to pos4-2, pos3-3, pos2-2. pos3-3 connects to pos4-3, pos3-4, pos2-3. pos3-4 connects to pos4-4, pos3-5, pos2-4. pos3-5 connects to pos4-5, pos3-4, pos2-5. So path: pos4-0 -> pos3-0 -> pos3-1 -> pos3-2 -> pos3-3 -> pos3-4 -> pos3-5. That path doesn't go through pos4-2. Good.\nBut we need to ensure robot can move through open positions. All positions are open except locked ones: pos3-1, pos2-1, pos1-3. Those are locked. But our path uses pos3-1, which is locked. Wait, pos3-1 is locked. So robot cannot enter pos3-1 unless unlocked.

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a plan that moves keys to target positions. We have a grid 5x5 positions pos0-0 to pos4-4. The robot starts at pos1-1. Keys: key0 at pos1-3, key1 at pos1-0, key2 at pos4-1, key3 at pos2-1. Goal: key0 at pos3-4, key1 at pos3-2, key3 at pos4-3. Key2 not in goal. We need to move keys accordingly.\nWe have actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. We need to move robot to positions, pick up keys, move them to target positions. We must obey constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-2)). So robot cannot be at pos1-2 at any time.\nAlso, we have locked positions: pos2-0, pos0-1, pos4-0, pos1-4. These are locked initially. We can unlock them by unlocking action if we have the key that matches shape and lock-shape matches shape. We have keys shapes: key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape2, key3 shape2. Lock shapes: pos2-0 shape0, pos0-1 shape1, pos4-0 shape2, pos1-4 shape2. So we can unlock pos2-0 with key0, pos0-1 with key1, pos4-0 with key2 or key3? Wait key2 shape2, key3 shape2. So either key2 or key3 can unlock pos4-0. pos1-4 locked shape2, so key2 or key3 can unlock pos1-4.\nWe need to move keys to target positions. Let's plan.\nWe need key0 at pos3-4. Currently key0 at pos1-3. We need to move robot to pos1-3, pick up key0, move to pos3-4. But we must avoid robot at pos1-2. That's fine.\nWe need key1 at pos3-2. Currently key1 at pos1-0. Move robot to pos1-0, pick up key1, move to pos3-2.\nWe need key3 at pos4-3. Currently key3 at pos2-1. Move robot to pos2-1, pick up key3, move to pos",

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: key1 at pos4-4 and key2 at pos4-5. Initially key1 at pos3-3, key2 at pos2-5. Robot at pos5-1. We need to move robot to pick up keys and put down at target positions. Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-4)). So robot cannot be at pos3-4 at any time. Also we must respect locked positions: pos5-0, pos0-2, pos4-1 are locked initially. We can unlock them by unlocking action if we have key matching shape. We have keys shapes: key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape2. Lock shapes: pos5-0 shape0, pos0-2 shape1, pos4-1 shape2. So we can unlock pos5-0 with key0, pos0-2 with key1, pos4-1 with key2. But we don't need to unlock those locked positions because goal doesn't involve them. But we might need to pass through them? The robot starts at pos5-1. To reach pos4-4 and pos4-5, we need to navigate grid. Let's examine connectivity. We need to move robot to pos4-4 and pos4-5. Are those positions reachable from pos5-1? Let's see connections: pos5-1 connected to pos5-2, pos4-1, pos5-0. pos4-1 is locked initially. So cannot go through pos4-1 unless unlocked. But we can unlock pos4-1 with key2 shape2. But key2 is at pos2-5. So we need to get key2 to unlock pos4-1. But we need key2 at pos4-5 eventually. So maybe we can unlock pos4-1, then move to pos4-5, then pick up key2 and put down at pos4-5. But we also need key1 at pos4-4. Key1 is at pos3-3 initially. We need to move key1 to pos4-4. That might require unlocking pos4-1? Not necessarily. Let's analyze connectivity to pos4-4. pos4-4 is open. It is connected to pos3-4, pos4-5, pos5-4. pos3-4 is open. pos5-4 is open. So robot",
