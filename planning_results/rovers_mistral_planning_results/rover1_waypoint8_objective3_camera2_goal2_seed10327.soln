Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that it can sample rocks and drop the samples at the current location. The plan also assumes that the camera is already equipped on the rover and that it can be calibrated when the calibration target is visible from the current location. The plan communicates the rock data to the lander and takes images with the camera in the specified modes.
