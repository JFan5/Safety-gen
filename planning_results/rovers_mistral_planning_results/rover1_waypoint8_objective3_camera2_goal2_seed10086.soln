Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective1 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint7)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint7 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints, and that the lander is available for communication when needed. The plan collects soil samples from waypoints 2 and 7, communicates the data to the lander, and takes images of waypoints 0 and 1 using low-resolution mode.
