Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint1 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint1 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 objective2 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint8)
(take_image rover0 waypoint8 objective1 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint9)
(take_image rover0 waypoint9 objective0 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint9 objective0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoints 1, 3, and 5, communicates the soil data to the lander, and takes images of waypoints 7, 8, and 9 with the appropriate cameras. The images are then communicated to the lander.
