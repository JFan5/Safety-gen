Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective2 camera0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint7 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the actions can be executed in the order given. The plan achieves the goal of communicating soil data from waypoints 1 and 2, rock data from waypoint 3, and an image of objective 2 using high-resolution camera in the color mode to the lander (general).
