Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint0 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint3 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint7 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified, and that the rover can take images and communicate data as described in the domain and problem. The plan aims to collect soil and rock samples from waypoints 0, 1, and 4, take an image of waypoint 3 using high-resolution mode, and communicate the soil, rock, and image data to the lander at waypoint 1. The plan ends by returning the rover to waypoint 2.
