Based on the provided domain and problem, here's a plan that satisfies the conditions:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint4)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint5)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint2)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective0 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective1 low_res)
```
