Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint4 rover0store)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective0 camera0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint4 waypoint5)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover is initially at waypoint1. The plan collects a soil sample at waypoint4, calibrates the camera for imaging at objective0, takes a high-resolution image of waypoint4, and then communicates the image data to the lander at waypoint5.
