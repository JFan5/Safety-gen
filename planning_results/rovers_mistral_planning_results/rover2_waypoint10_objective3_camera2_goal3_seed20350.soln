Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint5)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint0 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint6 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint2 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint3 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover1 general waypoint1 waypoint0 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop rover1store rover1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint3 waypoint2 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(take_image rover1 waypoint4 objective1 camera1 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective1 high_res waypoint4 rover0 rover1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint8)
(take_image rover0 waypoint8 objective0 low_res camera0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res waypoint8 rover0 rover1)
```

This plan assumes that the rovers can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan also assumes that the rovers are initially equipped for soil analysis, rock analysis, and imaging, as specified in the problem. The plan collects soil samples and rock samples from all the waypoints, communicates the soil data to the lander, drops the samples, navigates to other waypoints, takes images with the cameras, and communicates the images to the lander. The plan ends with the rovers returning to the lander.
