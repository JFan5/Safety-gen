Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint3 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective0 camera0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res waypoint5 waypoint4)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints, and that the initial state already satisfies all other preconditions for the actions in the plan. The plan collects a soil sample, takes a high-resolution image of the sample, and then communicates the image data to the lander.
