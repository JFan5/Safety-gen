Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 camera0 objective2 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general waypoint7 objective2 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoint0 and waypoint1, respectively, and communicates the data to the lander at waypoint4 and waypoint5, respectively. Finally, it takes an image of waypoint7 using camera0 and communicates the image data to the lander.
