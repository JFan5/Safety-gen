Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint7)
(drop rover0store waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint7 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(drop rover0store waypoint5)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 low_res)
```

This plan starts by navigating the rover to waypoint7, collecting a rock sample, dropping the sample, and then communicating the rock data back to the lander. It then repeats the same process for waypoint6 and waypoint5. Finally, it takes an image of waypoint5 using both the high-res and low-res cameras and communicates the image data back to the lander.
