Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint5 rover0store)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 camera0 colour)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour waypoint0 waypoint4)
```

This plan satisfies all the given conditions and constraints, and it respects the output requirements.
