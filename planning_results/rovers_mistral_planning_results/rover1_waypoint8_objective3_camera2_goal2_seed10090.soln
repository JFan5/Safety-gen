Based on the provided domain and problem, here's a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint7)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 colour camera0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 colour waypoint1 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between the waypoints as specified, that it has the necessary equipment, and that the lander is available for communication when needed. The plan achieves the goal of communicating rock data from waypoint3 and waypoint0, and communicating an image of objective1 in color mode.
