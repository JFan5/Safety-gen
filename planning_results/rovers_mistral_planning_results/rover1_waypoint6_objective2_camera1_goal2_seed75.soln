Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint2 objective1 high_res camera0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 high_res waypoint0)
```

This plan achieves the goal conditions and satisfies all hard constraints specified by PDDL3. The rover collects rock samples from waypoints 4 and 3, soil samples from waypoint 1, calibrates the camera for imaging, takes images of the collected rock sample at waypoint 2, and communicates the rock data and image data to the lander.
