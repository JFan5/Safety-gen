Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint0)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 objective0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective1 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can perform the required actions (sample soil, sample rock, navigate, communicate data, calibrate, and take images) as defined in the domain. The plan also assumes that the rover starts at waypoint3, as specified in the problem. The plan aims to collect soil samples from waypoints 0, 1, and 5, rock samples from waypoint 2, take high-resolution images of objective0 and color images of objective1, and communicate the collected data to the lander.
