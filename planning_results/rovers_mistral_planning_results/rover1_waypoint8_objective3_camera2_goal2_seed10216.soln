Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective1 colour camera0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint1 rover0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints, that it has the necessary equipment for soil analysis and imaging, and that the camera is calibrated for the specified objective. The plan also assumes that the lander is available and the channel is free when needed for communication. The plan achieves the goal of communicating the image data of objective1 in color mode.
