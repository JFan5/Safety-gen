Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given problem:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 camera0 low_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover is initially at waypoint2, and it can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain. The plan collects a soil sample at waypoint1, takes a low-resolution image of waypoint4, and then communicates the image data to the lander.
