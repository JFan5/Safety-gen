Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint3)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint5)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective2 camera0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint8)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint8 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint5)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint5)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample soil and rock, drop items from its store, take images, and communicate soil and rock data to the lander. The plan also assumes that the rover is initially equipped for soil analysis, imaging, and that it has a camera on board. The goal is achieved by first sampling soil at waypoint2, then communicating the soil data to the lander at waypoint0 and waypoint1. The rover then moves to waypoint3 to sample more soil, moves back to waypoint2 to drop the soil sample, takes an image of waypoint5 with the high-resolution camera, moves to waypoint6 to sample a rock, moves back to waypoint2 to drop the rock sample, and finally communicates the rock data to the lander at waypoint5, waypoint6, waypoint0, waypoint1, and waypoint4.
