Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(drop rover0store rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint0)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 objective0 camera0 low_res)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 low_res waypoint0 waypoint3)
```

This plan achieves the goal of communicating rock data from waypoint6 and an image of objective0 in low-res mode from rover0 to the lander general. The plan also satisfies all hard constraints specified by PDDL3 and uses only available symbols.
