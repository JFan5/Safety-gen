Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 objective1 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general waypoint7 objective1 high_res)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general waypoint7 objective1 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoint0 and waypoint3, communicates the data to the lander, and takes an image of waypoint7 using both high-res and color modes. The plan also drops the store after each use to make room for new samples or images.
