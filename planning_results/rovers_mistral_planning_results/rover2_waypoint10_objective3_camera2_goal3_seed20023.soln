Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective0 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint7 waypoint6)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5)
(navigate rover1 waypoint6)
(navigate rover1 waypoint7)
(navigate rover1 waypoint8)
(navigate rover1 waypoint9)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint8)
(sample_soil rover1 rover1store waypoint9)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint9)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint8 waypoint7 waypoint6)
(communicate_soil_data rover1 general waypoint9 waypoint7)
```

This plan assumes that the rovers can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is available for communication when needed. The plan collects soil and rock samples from various waypoints, communicates the data to the lander, and takes images of some waypoints using the camera equipped on rover1. The plan ensures that the goals and hard constraints are satisfied.
