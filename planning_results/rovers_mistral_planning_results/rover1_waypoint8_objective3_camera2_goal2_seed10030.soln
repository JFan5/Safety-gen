Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint1 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint3)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint3 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(sample_soil rover0 waypoint5 rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint7)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint7 rover0store)
(drop rover0store waypoint7)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective2)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 camera0 high_res objective2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 camera0 low_res objective2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint7)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between all waypoints, and that the samples can be taken and dropped in the order specified. The plan also assumes that the camera is calibrated before taking images, and that the images are communicated to the lander after they are taken.
