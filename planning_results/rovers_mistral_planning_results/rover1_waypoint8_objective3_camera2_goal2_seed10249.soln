Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint0)
(drop rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective0 colour camera0)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 colour)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the initial state allows the rover to be at waypoint1 with the required resources and preconditions for the actions to execute. The plan collects a rock sample from waypoint0, moves the rover to waypoint5, calibrates the camera, takes an image, and communicates the rock data and image data to the lander.
