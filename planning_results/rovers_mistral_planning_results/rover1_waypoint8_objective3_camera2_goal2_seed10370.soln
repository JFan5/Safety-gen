Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint0 high_res)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint0 waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint7)
(drop rover0store)
(calibrate rover0 camera1 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint7 high_res)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint7 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3)
(drop rover0store)
(calibrate rover0 camera1 objective2)
(take_image rover0 waypoint3 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 low_res)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint6)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between all waypoints, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples, calibrates the cameras, takes images, and communicates the data back to the lander. The plan also ensures that the rover visits waypoint 3 before returning to waypoint 0, as specified by the constraint.
