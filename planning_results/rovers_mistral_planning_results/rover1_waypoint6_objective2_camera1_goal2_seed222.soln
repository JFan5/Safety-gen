Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal conditions:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint2 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4)
(take_image rover0 waypoint4 objective0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between all waypoints, and that the lander is always available when needed for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoint0 and waypoint1, communicates the data to the lander, takes an image of waypoint4, and communicates the image data to the lander. The plan then repeats the process for waypoint2, and finally communicates the second set of soil data from waypoint1.
