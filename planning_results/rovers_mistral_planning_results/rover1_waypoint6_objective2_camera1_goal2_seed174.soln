Based on the provided domain and problem, here's a valid plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 high_res objective1)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 low_res objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 high_res camera0)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective1 low_res camera0)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 low_res)
```

This plan assumes that the initial state satisfies all other conditions and constraints, as specified in the problem. The plan achieves the goal by navigating the rover to the appropriate waypoints, calibrating the camera, taking images, and communicating the data back to the lander.
