Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint7)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint0)
(drop rover0store waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint5)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective2 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint5 waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint6)
(take_image rover0 waypoint6 objective0 high_res)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective2 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the lander is always available for communication. The plan collects soil and rock samples from waypoint0, communicates the data to the lander, moves to other waypoints to take images with the camera, and communicates the image data to the lander. The plan also drops the store after using it to store samples.
