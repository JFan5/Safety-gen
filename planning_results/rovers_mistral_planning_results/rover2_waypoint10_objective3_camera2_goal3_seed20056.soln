(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint3)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint3 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(drop rover0store rover0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint1 waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint0 waypoint3 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint8)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint4)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4 waypoint2)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2 waypoint5)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5 waypoint6)
(take_image rover1 waypoint6 low_res objective1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint6 waypoint1)
(navigate rover1 waypoint1 waypoint7)
(navigate rover1 waypoint7 waypoint8)
(take_image rover1 waypoint8 high_res objective0)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective1 low_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective0 high_res)
