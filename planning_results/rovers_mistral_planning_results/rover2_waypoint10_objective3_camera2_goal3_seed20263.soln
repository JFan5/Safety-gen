Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_soil rover0 rover0store waypoint1)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint1 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint8)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint0 waypoint8)
(drop rover0store)
(navigate rover0 waypoint9)
(communicate_soil_data rover0 general waypoint6 waypoint9 waypoint0)
(navigate rover1 waypoint4)
(sample_soil rover1 rover1store waypoint4)
(navigate rover1 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint2)
(navigate rover1 waypoint3)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint2 waypoint0 waypoint3)
(drop rover1store)
(navigate rover1 waypoint5)
(take_image rover1 waypoint5 objective2 high_res)
(take_image rover1 waypoint5 objective2 low_res)
(navigate rover1 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective2 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover1 general objective2 low_res)
(drop rover1store)
(navigate rover1 waypoint0)
(communicate_soil_data rover1 general waypoint5 waypoint0)
```
