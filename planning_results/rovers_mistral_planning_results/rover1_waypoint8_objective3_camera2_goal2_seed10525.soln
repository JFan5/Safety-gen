Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan for the given scenario:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint7 waypoint6)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint6)
(drop rover0store waypoint6)
(navigate rover0 waypoint6 waypoint4)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint4)
(drop rover0store waypoint4)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint4 waypoint0)
(navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint1 objective0 high_res)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective0 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints, and that it has the necessary equipment for rock sampling and imaging. The plan also assumes that the lander is available for communication. The plan achieves the goal of communicating rock data from waypoint4 and an image in high-resolution mode from objective0.
