Based on the provided domain and problem, here is a possible plan to achieve the goal:

```
(navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint2)
(drop rover0store waypoint2)
(navigate rover0 waypoint2 waypoint5)
(sample_rock rover0 rover0store waypoint5)
(drop rover0store waypoint5)
(calibrate rover0 camera0 objective1)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 colour)
(take_image rover0 waypoint5 objective1 high_res)
(communicate_rock_data rover0 general waypoint5 waypoint0 waypoint1)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 colour)
(communicate_image_data rover0 general objective1 high_res)
```

This plan assumes that the rover can traverse between waypoints as specified in the domain, and that the rover can sample rocks and drop the store at the current waypoint. The plan also assumes that the camera is already equipped for imaging and rock analysis, and that the objective for which to communicate the data is already set to 'objective1'. The plan also assumes that the lander is available and the channel is free when needed for communication.
