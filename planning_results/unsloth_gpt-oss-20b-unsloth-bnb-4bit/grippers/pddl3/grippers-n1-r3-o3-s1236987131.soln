<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a grounded plan for the problem. Let's analyze the problem.

Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.

Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.

Actions:

move: parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room). Precondition: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.

pick: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper). Precondition: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.

drop: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper). Precondition: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.

Problem: objects: robot1, rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms room1, room2, room3, objects ball1, ball2, ball3.

Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room2

Goal:
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room2

We need to move ball1 to room3, ball2 to room1, ball3 stays at room2.

We have two grippers: rgripper1 and lgripper1. Robot can carry one object at a time with a gripper. We need to pick up ball1 from room2, drop at room3. Ball2 from room3 to room1. Ball3 stays at room2.

Robot starts at room3. So ball2 is at room3 initially. Robot can pick ball2 directly. But we need ball1 at room3, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2.

We need to plan.

Let's think: robot at room3. We can pick ball2 at room3, drop at room1. But ball1 is at room2. We need to pick ball1 and drop at room3. But ball3 stays at room2.

We have two grippers, but only one object at a time. But we can use both grippers to carry two objects simultaneously? But the domain doesn't restrict that. The robot can pick up an object with a gripper if free. It can carry multiple objects with different grippers? The precondition for pick: free robot gripper. So each gripper must be free. So robot can pick up two objects simultaneously if both grippers are free. But we need to ensure that the robot can pick up ball1 and ball3 simultaneously? But ball3 stays at room2, so we don't need to move it. So we only need to move ball1 and ball2.

We need to plan a sequence:

Start: robot at room3. free rgripper1, free lgripper1. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2.

Goal: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2.

Plan: Move robot to room2 to pick ball1. But robot at room3. So first move to room2. Then pick ball1 with one gripper. Then move to room3 to drop ball1. Then pick ball2 at room3? Wait ball2 is at room3 initially. But we need ball2 at room1. So we need to pick ball2 at room3 and drop at room1. But we also need ball1 at room3. So we can do: robot at room3, pick ball2, drop at room1. But we also need ball1 at room3. So we need to pick ball1 from room2 and drop at room3. So we need to pick ball1 after dropping ball2? Let's think.

Sequence:

1. move robot from room3 to room2.
2. pick ball1 at room2 with rgripper1 (or lgripper1).
3. move robot to room3.
4. drop ball1 at room3.
5. pick ball2 at room3 with other gripper? But robot currently at room3. But ball2 is at room3. But we need ball2 at room1. So we can pick ball2 with the other gripper (free). But we need to ensure that we don't pick ball2 while carrying ball1. But we can carry ball1 with one gripper, ball2 with the other. But we need to drop ball1 at room3 before picking ball2? But we can pick ball2 while carrying ball1? Let's examine.

We have two grippers. We can pick ball1 with rgripper1, ball2 with lgripper1 simultaneously. But ball2 is at room3. But robot at room3. But ball1 is at room2. So we need to move to room2 to pick ball1. But we can't pick ball2 at room3 until we are at room3. So we need to pick ball1 first, then drop at room3, then pick ball2 at room3, drop at room1.

But we can also pick ball2 first, drop at room1, then pick ball1. But ball1 is at room2. So we need to move to room2 to pick ball1. So either order is fine.

Let's design plan:

Option 1: Pick ball1 first, drop at room3, then pick ball2, drop at room1.

But we need to ensure that ball2 is at room3 initially. So we can pick ball2 at room3 after dropping ball1. But we need to ensure that ball1 is at room3 after dropping. So plan:

- move robot from room3 to room2.
- pick ball1 at room2 with rgripper1.
- move robot to room3.
- drop ball1 at room3.
- pick ball2 at room3 with lgripper1.
- move robot to room1.
- drop ball2 at room1.

But we need to ensure that after dropping ball1, the robot is at room3. But we need to move to room1 to drop ball2. So we need to move robot to room1. But we also need to ensure that we have free gripper for ball2. After dropping ball1, lgripper1 is free. So we can pick ball2 with lgripper1.

But we need to ensure that we don't pick ball2 while carrying ball1. But we can pick ball2 after dropping ball1. So we need to plan accordingly.

Let's check each step:

Initial state: robot at room3, free rgripper1, free lgripper1, ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2.

Step 1: move robot from room3 to room2. Precondition: at-robby robot1 room3. After move: at-robby robot1 room2. Also not at-robby robot1 room3.

Step 2: pick ball1 at room2 with rgripper1. Precondition: at ball1 room2, at-robby robot1 room2, free robot1 rgripper1. After pick: carry robot1 ball1 rgripper1, not at ball1 room2, not free robot1 rgripper1.

Step 3: move robot from room2 to room3. Precondition: at-robby robot1 room2. After: at-robby robot1 room3.

Step 4: drop ball1 at room3 with rgripper1. Precondition: carry robot1 ball1 rgripper1, at-robby robot1 room3. After: at ball1 room3, free robot1 rgripper1, not carry robot1 ball1 rgripper1.

Now robot at room3, free rgripper1, free lgripper1. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2.

Step 5: pick ball2 at room3 with lgripper1. Precondition: at ball2 room3, at-robby robot1 room3, free robot1 lgripper1. After: carry robot1 ball2 lgripper1, not at ball2 room3, not free robot1 lgripper1.

Step 6: move robot from room3 to room1. Precondition: at-robby robot1 room3. After: at-robby robot1 room1.

Step 7: drop ball2 at room1 with lgripper1. Precondition: carry robot1 ball2 lgripper1, at-robby robot1 room1. After: at ball2 room1, free robot1 lgripper1, not carry robot1 ball2 lgripper1.

Now final state: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2. All goals satisfied.

Check invariants: At each step, preconditions hold. Yes.

Thus plan is valid.

Now we need to output each action line: action name and objects.

Action names: move, pick
