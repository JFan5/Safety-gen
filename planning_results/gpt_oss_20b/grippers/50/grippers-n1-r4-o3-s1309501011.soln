analysisThe user provided a domain and problem for a gripper. The domain includes a constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))). So robot1 must never carry any object in the left gripper. The problem has 3 balls all in room2 initially, robot1 in room1, both grippers free. Goal: ball1 in room4, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room3.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and the constraint. The constraint forbids robot1 carrying any ball with lgripper1 at any time. So robot1 can only use rgripper1 to carry objects. So all pick actions must use rgripper1, and drop actions must also use rgripper1. lgripper1 must remain free always.
We need to move robot and balls accordingly.
Initial:
robot1 at room1
rgripper1 free
lgripper1 free
ball1 at room2
ball2 at room2
ball3 at room2
Goal:
ball1 at room4
ball2 at room1
ball3 at room3
We need to plan robot movements and picks/drops.
Strategy:
- Move robot to room2, pick ball1 with rgripper1.
- Move to room4, drop ball1.
- Move back to room2, pick ball2 with rgripper1.
- Move to room1, drop ball2.
- Move to room2, pick ball3 with rgripper1.
- Move to room3, drop ball3.
- Ensure robot ends at room2? Not constrained. So final state: robot1 at room2, rgripper1 free, lgripper1 free, ball1 at room4, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3. That satisfies goal and constraint.
Check constraints: always no ball carried with lgripper1. We never use lgripper1 for pick/drop, so it's always free. So constraint satisfied.
Check all action preconditions:
- move: need at-robby robot1 from, to rooms. We'll plan accordingly.
- pick: need at ball
