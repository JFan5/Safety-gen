analysisWe need to produce a plan for the gripper domain with 2 robots, 4 rooms, 4 balls. The initial state:
- robot1 at room3
- robot1 grippers: rgripper1 free, lgripper1 free
- robot2 at room2
- robot2 grippers: rgripper2 free, lgripper2 free
Objects:
- balls: ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room3
- ball4 at room3
Goal:
- ball1 at room2 (already)
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Constraints (PDDL3):
- always not (robot1 at room1 and robot2 at room1)
- always not (robot1 at room3 and robot2 at room3)
So robots cannot be simultaneously in room1 or room3. They can be in room2 or room4 together.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room1, ball4 from room3 to room1. ball1 stays at room2.
Robots can cooperate. They have two grippers each, can carry two balls simultaneously (one per gripper). They can pick and drop.
We must avoid constraint violations at all times.
Let's analyze initial positions:
- robot1: room3
- robot2: room2
- ball1: room2
- ball2: room1
- ball3: room3
- ball4: room3
Goal positions:
- ball2: room3
- ball3: room1
- ball4: room1
So we need to move ball2 to room3, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room1
