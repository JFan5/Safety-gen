commentary# The user has provided a PDDL domain and a problem. The domain is "gripper-strips" with typing, predicates, and three actions: move, pick, drop.
# Problem "gripper-2-4-3" details:
# Objects:
#   robot1 robot2 - robot
#   rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2 - gripper
#   room1 room2 room3 room4 - room
#   ball1 ball2 ball3 - object
# Initial state:
#   at-robby robot1 room1
#   free robot1 rgripper1
#   free robot1 lgripper1
#   at-robby robot2 room4
#   free robot2 rgripper2
#   free robot2 lgripper2
#   at ball1 room4
#   at ball2 room3
#   at ball3 room3
# Goal:
#   at ball1 room2
#   at ball2 room3
#   at ball3 room3
# So ball2 and ball3 are already at their goal locations (room3). ball1 needs to move from room4 to room2.
# Constraints:
#   (:constraints
#     (always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)))
#   )
# So robot1 must never be in room3. That's the only constraint.
# Let's analyze the goal: ball2 and ball3 are already satisfied. So we only need to move ball1 to room2.
# ball1 starts at room4. robot2 starts at room4. robot1 starts at room1.
# So robot2 can pick ball1 immediately.
# Then robot2 must move to room2 to drop ball1.
# We must ensure robot1 never goes to room3.
# There's no restriction on robot2 visiting room3 or other rooms.
# Also, we must ensure that during the plan, robot1 never ends up in room3.
# Since robot1 starts at room1, we can move it around as needed, but must avoid room3.
# The goal doesn't constrain robot1 or robot2 positions, so they can be anywhere at the end, as long as constraints hold.
# Let's check potential interactions:
# - The constraints only involve robot1 and room3. So robot2 can freely move anywhere, including room3, to pick or
