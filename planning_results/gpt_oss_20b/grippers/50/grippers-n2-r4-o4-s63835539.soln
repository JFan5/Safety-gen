commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always not at-robby robot1 room4. So robot1 cannot be in room4 at any time. Goal: ball1 room4, ball2 room3, ball3 room1, ball4 room3. Robot1 starts room3, robot2 room2. Grippers free. Balls: ball1 room1, ball2 room4, ball3 room3, ball4 room3.
We need to move ball1 to room4, ball2 to room3, ball3 to room1, ball4 stays room3. Robot1 cannot go to room4. So ball1 must be transported by robot2. Robot2 can go to room4. Robot1 cannot go to room4, but can go to other rooms. So plan: robot2 move to room4, pick ball1, move to room3? Wait goal ball1 room4. So robot2 must end at room4 with ball1. But robot2 cannot stay at room4 with ball1? It's allowed. Constraint only about robot1. So robot2 can be at room4. So robot2 will pick ball1 at room4? Wait ball1 starts room1. So robot2 must go to room1, pick ball1, move to room4, drop. But robot2 starts room2. So route: room2 -> room3? room2 connected to room3? We don't have connectivity info. In gripper domain, rooms are connected arbitrarily; but usually move action requires from and to rooms; no constraints on connectivity. So we can move between any rooms. So robot2 can move directly room2 to room1, etc. So plan: robot2 move room2 room1, pick ball1 room1 rgripper2, move room1 room4, drop ball1 room4 rgripper2. Good.
Now ball2 must go to room3. ball2 starts room4. Robot1 starts room3 but cannot go to room4. Robot2 can go to room4. So ball2 can be moved by robot1? robot1 starts room3, ball2 at room4. So robot1 cannot reach ball2 unless robot2 moves ball2 to room3? But robot1 cannot go to room4, so cannot pick ball2 directly. So we need robot2 to pick ball2 at room4, move to room3, drop. But ball2 goal room3. So
