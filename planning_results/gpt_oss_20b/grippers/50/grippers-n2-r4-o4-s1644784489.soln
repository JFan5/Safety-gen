commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room1)). So robot1 cannot ever be in room1. Initially robot1 at room3, robot2 at room3. Balls: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3, ball4 at room4. Goal: ball1 room4, ball2 room2, ball3 room1, ball4 room1. Robot1 cannot go to room1, but ball3 must end at room1, ball4 and ball2 also at room1. So robot1 cannot be used to move to room1. So robot2 must go to room1 to handle ball3 and ball4 and ball1? ball1 to room4, ball2 to room2, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room1. So robot2 will go to room1 to pick ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4. But robot2 can go to room1. Need to move ball1 to room4, ball2 to room2, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room1. So robot2 will go to room1, pick ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4? But gripper has two grippers. It can carry at most one object per gripper. So to move ball1 to room4, robot2 must pick ball1 with one gripper, go to room4, drop. Then ball2 to room2: pick ball2, go to room2, drop. ball3 to room1: pick ball3, go to room1, drop. ball4 to room1: pick ball4, go to room1, drop. But note ball3 and ball4 both need to end in room1. So robot2 will need to go to room1 twice: once to pick ball3, once to pick ball4. But ball1 and ball2 are at room1 initially. So robot2 will need to pick ball1 and ball2 first, then go to room4 and room2, then return to room1 to pick ball3 and ball4. But need to ensure that when robot2 goes to room4, ball1 is still in room1; ball2 still in room1; ball3 in room3; ball4 in room4. Wait ball4 initially at room4. So robot2 will need to pick ball4 from room4
