commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be in room4 at any time. Goal: ball1 room4, ball2 room3, ball3 room4, ball4 room4. Robot2 starts room4, robot1 room3. Balls: ball1 room3, ball2 room3, ball3 room4, ball4 room3. Robot2 can move to room3, etc. Robot1 cannot go to room4, so it cannot transport balls to room4. Therefore robot1 cannot be used to deliver balls to room4. Robot2 must do all deliveries to room4. But robot2 starts room4, and constraint only forbids robot1 room4, not robot2. So robot2 can be in room4. Good.
Goal requires ball1, ball3, ball4 in room4. ball2 stays in room3. Initially ball1, ball2, ball4 in room3; ball3 in room4. So we need to move ball1 and ball4 from room3 to room4, and ball3 stays already in room4. Also ball4 currently room3 to room4. ball1 currently room3 to room4. ball2 stays room3.
Robots: robot1 room3, free grippers rgripper1 lgripper1. robot2 room4, free rgripper2 lgripper2. So robot2 can pick ball1 or ball4? But robot2 is in room4, ball1 and ball4 are in room3. So robot2 must move to room3 first. Also robot1 is in room3, so robot1 could pick ball1 or ball4, but robot1 cannot go to room4, so it cannot deliver them. So robot1 cannot be used for these tasks. So robot2 must move to room3, pick ball1 and ball4, then move to room4 and drop them. But robot2 has two grippers, so it could pick both balls simultaneously. However need to consider constraints: Are there any constraints about grippers? None. Also constraints about rooms? Only robot1 room4 forbidden. So robot2 can be in room4 freely. So plan: robot2 move room4->room3, pick ball1 with rgripper2, pick ball4 with lgripper2, move room3->room4, drop ball1 with
