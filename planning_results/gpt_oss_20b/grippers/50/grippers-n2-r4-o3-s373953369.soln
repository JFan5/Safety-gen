commentary# Plan Generation for gripper-2-4-3
## Domain Recap
- **Types**: room, object, robot, gripper
- **Objects**:
- Robots: robot1, robot2
- Grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2
- Rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4
- Objects: ball1, ball2, ball3
## Initial State
- Robot positions:
- robot1 at room4
- robot2 at room2
- Gripper statuses:
- robot1: rgripper1 free, lgripper1 free
- robot2: rgripper2 free, lgripper2 free
- Object locations:
- ball1 at room3
- ball2 at room2
- ball3 at room2
## Goal State
- ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room2
## PDDL3 Constraints
1. **Always avoid room3 with robot1**:
- `(always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)))`
- This constraint forbids robot1 from ever entering room3.
## Goal Analysis
- **ball3**: Already at room2 → no action needed.
- **ball2**: Needs to move from room2 to room1.
- **ball1**: Needs to move from room3 to room2.
## Strategy
- Use **robot2** for both ball1 and ball2 because:
- robot2 starts in room2, which is the target for ball1.
- robot2 can reach room1 (target for ball2) without violating constraints.
- robot1 will remain in room4 or move to room1/room2 as needed, but never to room3.
- Since robot2 starts in room2, it can:
1. Pick up **ball1** (currently in room3) → requires moving to room3.
2. Move to room2 while carrying ball1 → drop ball1 at room2 (goal satisfied).
3. Move to room1 while free → pick up **ball2** (room2) → move to room1 → drop ball2 (goal satisfied).
- Ensure robot1 never enters room3; it will stay in room4 or move to room1/
