commentaryWe need to produce a plan for gripper-2-4-3 domain with 2 robots, 4 rooms, 3 balls. Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room3. Initial: robot1 at room4, robot2 at room3. Both grippers free. ball1 at room4, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room4.
Constraints: PDDL3: always not (and (at-robby robot1 room3) (at-robby robot2 room3)). So robots cannot be both in room3 simultaneously at any time.
Goal requires ball3 at room3. Initially ball3 at room4. robot2 is already at room3, so robot2 can pick ball3 there? Wait ball3 at room4, so robot2 cannot pick it initially. robot1 at room4 can pick ball3. But robot1 is at room4, ball3 at room4, so pick possible. But then robot1 would be at room4 with ball3. To get ball3 to room3, robot1 could move to room3 with ball3, but then robot2 is also at room3 initially. Constraint would be violated if both robots at room3 simultaneously. So we need to coordinate: either robot2 moves away before robot1 arrives at room3, or robot1 moves to room3 after robot2 leaves. Also goal requires ball2 at room2. ball2 initially at room3. robot2 at room3 can pick ball2. Then robot2 could move to room2 with ball2. But robot1 might need to be at room3 to pick ball3? Actually robot1 can pick ball3 at room4, then move to room3 with ball3. But robot2 is at room3 initially; if robot2 stays, constraint violated. So robot2 must move away before robot1 arrives at room3. Options: robot2 could move to room2 or room4 or room1. But room2 is goal for ball2; robot2 could move to room2, then pick ball2? Wait ball2 at room3 initially. So robot2 could pick ball2 at room3, then move to room2, drop ball2. That would satisfy ball2 goal. After dropping, robot2 would be at room2 free. Good. Then robot1 can move to room3 with ball3. But robot1 must pick ball3 at room4. So sequence:
