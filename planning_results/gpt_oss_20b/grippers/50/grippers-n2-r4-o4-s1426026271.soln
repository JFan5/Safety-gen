commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. Initially robot1 at room1, robot2 at room2. Balls: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room2, ball4 at room3. Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room4. Robot2 can stay anywhere; no constraint on robot2. Robot1 cannot go to room3. So to bring ball1 from room3 to room1, we need robot1 to go from room1 to some room that can reach room3? But robot1 cannot be in room3, but can pick ball1 in room3. So robot1 must move from room1 to a room that can reach room3, e.g., room4 or room2 or room1? Let's check connectivity: rooms are nodes; moves defined by action move with parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room). There is no restriction on rooms connectivity; any robot can move from any room to any room as long as precondition (at-robby ?r ?from) holds. So connectivity is fully connected. So robot1 can move from room1 to room4, then to room3 to pick ball1, then to room1 to drop ball1. But constraint prohibits robot1 being at room3 at any time. So robot1 cannot be at room3. That means robot1 cannot pick ball1 because pick requires (at-robby ?r ?room) and (at ?obj ?room). So robot1 cannot pick ball1 because it cannot be in room3. So we must use robot2 to pick ball1. But robot2 initially at room2. It can move to room3, pick ball1, move to room1, drop ball1. No constraint on robot2. So robot2 will handle ball1. Robot1 must handle ball3 and ball4 to room4. Ball2 is already at room2, goal room2, so no action needed for ball2. Ball3 at room2, goal room4. Ball4 at room3, goal room4. Robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time, so cannot pick ball4. So robot2 must pick ball4. So robot2 will handle ball1 and ball4
