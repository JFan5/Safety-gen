However, it uses lgripper1 to pick up both ball1 and ball3. If the domain or problem had any additional constraints on lgripper (e.g., it can only hold one specific type of object or must be free before picking up ball3), those would be violated. Since no such constraints are present, the plan remains valid. If lgripper1 were restricted in a way not shown here, you would need to adjust the plan accordingly, possibly using rgripper1 for one of the balls or reordering actions to respect the constraints.
