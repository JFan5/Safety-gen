commentary# The user has provided a PDDL domain and problem. The domain is "gripper-strips" with typing,
# predicates: at-robby (?r - robot ?x - room), at (?o - object ?x - room), free (?r - robot ?g - gripper),
# carry (?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper).
# Actions:
# move: parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
#   precondition: (at-robby ?r ?from)
#   effect: (at-robby ?r ?to) (not (at-robby ?r ?from))
# pick: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
