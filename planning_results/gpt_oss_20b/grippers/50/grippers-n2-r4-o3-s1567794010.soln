commentaryWe need to produce a plan for the gripper domain with 2 robots, 4 rooms, 3 balls. Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1 (already there). Initial: robot1 at room1, free both grippers; robot2 at room4, free both grippers; ball1 at room3; ball2 at room4; ball3 at room1.
Constraints: PDDL3: always not (robot1 at room4 and robot2 at room4). So they cannot be in room4 simultaneously. Initially robot2 is at room4, robot1 at room1, so constraint satisfied. We must ensure during plan they never both at room4.
Goal: ball1 room4, ball2 room2, ball3 room1. ball3 already at room1, so no need to move it. ball2 initially at room4, goal at room2. ball1 initially room3, goal room4.
Robots can use both grippers. They can carry at most one object per gripper. They can pick ball only if at same room and gripper free. They can drop only if carrying and at same room.
We need to plan moves, picks, drops. Also constraint about both robots not in room4 simultaneously. So if robot2 stays at room4 while robot1 moves to room4 to pick ball1, constraint violated. So robot1 must not go to room4 while robot2 is there. So robot2 must move out of room4 before robot1 goes to room4. But robot2 initially at room4 and ball2 is also at room4. To move ball2 to room2, robot2 must pick it up. So robot2 must leave room4 carrying ball2. That means robot2 will not be at room4 during that time. So robot1 can go to room4 safely. But we must ensure that after robot2 returns to room4 (maybe to drop ball1?), they don't both be there. But ball1 goal is room4, so robot1 will need to drop ball1 at room4. At that time robot2 must not be at room4. So robot2 must be elsewhere when robot1 drops ball1. So we need to schedule robot2 to return to room4 after robot1 has finished? Wait ball2 goal is room2, so robot2 will eventually go to room2 to drop ball2. So robot2 will be at room2 at
