commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. Goal: ball1 room3, ball2 room2, ball3 room1, ball4 room4. Initial: robot1 room4; robot2 room3. Balls: ball1 room4; ball2 room2; ball3 room4; ball4 room3. Robot2 starts in room3, which is forbidden for robot1 only. So robot2 can be in room3. Constraint only about robot1. So we must avoid moving robot1 to room3. That's fine.
We need to move ball1 to room3, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room4. ball2 already at room2, good.
We have two robots, each with two grippers (rgripper, lgripper). They can pick/draw balls. Balls are objects; no size constraints. So each robot can carry one ball per gripper.
We need to plan sequence of moves, picks, drops. Constraint: robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time. So robot1 must avoid room3. It starts at room4, so fine. It can move to room1, room2, room4. It cannot go to room3. Robot2 starts at room3, can move anywhere. So we can use robot2 to bring ball1 to room3, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room4. But ball4 starts at room3; goal room4. So robot2 can pick ball4 at room3 and move to room4 and drop. But robot2 also needs to bring ball1 from room4 to room3. So robot2 will need to move from room3 to room4, pick ball1, move to room3, drop ball1. But robot2 also needs to bring ball4 from room3 to room4. But after first step, robot2 will be at room3 with ball4. But we might need to pick ball4 before picking ball1? Let's analyze.
Initial:
robot1: room4, free rgripper1, lgripper1
robot2: room3, free rgripper2, lgripper2
balls:
ball1: room4
ball2: room2
ball3: room4
ball4: room3
Goal:
ball1: room3
