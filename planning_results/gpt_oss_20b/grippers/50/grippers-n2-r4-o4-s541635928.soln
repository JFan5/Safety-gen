commentaryWe must produce plan for gripper domain with 2 robots, 4 grippers each, 4 rooms, 4 balls. Goal: ball1 room1, ball2 room2, ball3 room4, ball4 room1. Initial: robot1 at room3, free rgripper1, lgripper1; robot2 at room1, free rgripper2, lgripper2; ball1 room1; ball2 room4; ball3 room1; ball4 room1. Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be in room4 at any time. That's the only constraint. So plan must avoid robot1 room4. That's fine.
We need to move ball2 from room4 to room2; ball3 from room1 to room4; others already at room1. robot1 starts room3; robot2 room1. robot2 can pick ball2 in room4? No robot2 is room1. So robot1 must go to room4 to pick ball2? But constraint forbids robot1 at room4. So ball2 must be moved by robot2. So robot2 must travel from room1 to room4, pick ball2, then to room2, drop. Meanwhile robot1 can handle ball3 to room4? But robot1 cannot go to room4. So ball3 must be moved by robot2 as well. But robot2 already carrying ball2. Grippers: each robot has two. So robot2 can pick ball3 while carrying ball2? No, each pick requires free gripper. So robot2 must drop ball2 before picking ball3. But ball2 needs to go to room2. So sequence: robot2 room1 -> room4; pick ball2; room4 -> room2; drop ball2; room2 -> room1; pick ball3; room1 -> room4; drop ball3. Meanwhile robot1 can maybe move ball1 or ball4? They are already at room1, goal same. So robot1 can stay or maybe help. But constraint only about room4. So robot1 could move to room3 etc. But no need. So plan: robot2 actions only. Ensure robot1 never room4. It starts room3, stays there. So fine.
Check initial: ball1 room1, ball3 room1, ball4 room1. Goal: ball1 room1, ball4 room1. So they stay
