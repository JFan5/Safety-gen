commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 domain with 2 robots, 4 rooms, 4 objects (balls), 4 grippers (2 per robot). Goal: ball1 room2, ball2 room3, ball3 room1, ball4 room4. Constraints: always not (robot1 room4 and robot2 room4) simultaneously. So they cannot both be in room4 at same time.
We need to move robots and grippers to pick and drop accordingly.
Initial state:
robot1 at room1, free rgripper1, lgripper1
robot2 at room2, free rgripper2, lgripper2
ball1 at room4
ball2 at room3
ball3 at room4
ball4 at room2
Goal:
ball1 at room2
ball2 at room3 (already there)
ball3 at room1
ball4 at room4
So ball2 is already at room3, good. ball4 needs to move from room2 to room4. ball1 from room4 to room2. ball3 from room4 to room1.
Robots can help. Constraint forbids both robots in room4 simultaneously. So when one robot needs to be in room4 to pick ball1 or ball3, the other must be elsewhere (room1,2,3). Also robot2 starts at room2, ball4 there. So robot2 can pick ball4 and move to room4 to drop. That would satisfy ball4 goal. Meanwhile robot1 can handle ball1 and ball3. But robot1 starts at room1, ball3 and ball1 at room4. So robot1 must move to room4 to pick ball3 and ball1. But robot2 might also need to be at room4 to pick ball4? Actually robot2 can pick ball4 at room2 and move to room4 to drop. So robot2 will be at room4 at some point. Constraint: cannot have both robots at room4 simultaneously. So when robot2 goes to room4, robot1 must be elsewhere (room1,2,3). But robot1 needs to be at room4 to pick ball1 and ball3. So we need to schedule: robot1 goes to room4, picks ball3, maybe moves to room1 to drop ball3. Meanwhile robot2 stays at room2 or moves elsewhere. Then robot1 might go back to room4 to pick ball1, then
