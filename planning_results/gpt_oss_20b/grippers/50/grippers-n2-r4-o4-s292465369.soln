commentaryWe need to generate a plan for gripper-2-4-4 domain with 2 robots, 4 rooms, 4 balls, 4 grippers (2 per robot: rgripper and lgripper). Initial positions: robot1 at room1, free rgripper1, lgripper1. robot2 at room1, free rgripper2, lgripper2. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3, ball4 at room2. Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2, ball4 at room1. Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. That's fine.
We need to use only move, pick, drop actions. Need to ensure constraints: robot1 never in room3. Also need to maintain free/don't pick when not free, etc. Also need to ensure that ball3 ends at room2, ball1 at room1, ball4 at room1. ball2 already at room1 initially, so stays.
We have two robots, so we can coordinate. We need to move ball1 from room2 to room1. ball4 from room2 to room1. ball3 from room3 to room2. ball2 already at room1.
We must avoid robot1 entering room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can. So we can use robot2 to handle ball3. But ball3 starts at room3, so robot2 must go to room3. That's allowed. Then robot2 can pick ball3, move to room2, drop. That satisfies ball3 at room2.
Now ball1 and ball4 from room2 to room1. Both start at room2. We can use either robot. But robot1 cannot go to room3, but that's irrelevant. So we can use robot1 or robot2. But robot2 will be busy with ball3. We could schedule: robot1 handles ball1 and ball4. But need to ensure that robot1 doesn't go to room3. That's fine. So robot1 can move from room1 to room2, pick ball1, move back to room1, drop ball1. Then move to room2 again, pick ball4, move back to room1, drop ball4. That achieves goals.
We must ensure that at no time ball
