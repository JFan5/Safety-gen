commentaryWe must produce a plan for gripper-2-4-4 with constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. Goal: ball1 room1, ball2 room2, ball3 room3, ball4 room1. Initial: robot1 room4, free grippers; robot2 room1, free grippers; ball1 room1; ball2 room2; ball3 room2; ball4 room4.
We need to move ball3 to room3, ball4 to room1. robot1 cannot go to room3, so robot2 must handle ball3 and ball4. robot1 can handle ball1 and ball2? ball1 already room1, ball2 room2. robot1 could move ball2? ball2 room2, goal room2, so stays. ball1 room1 goal room1, so stays. So robot1 may stay room4 or move elsewhere but not room3. robot1 could move to room1 to pick ball1? but ball1 already goal. So robot1 may stay room4 or move to room2 or room1 or room4. But must avoid room3. So plan: robot2 picks ball3 room2, moves to room3, drop. robot2 picks ball4 room4, moves to room1, drop. Ensure robot2 never in room3 while picking ball4? It's fine. Also ensure robot2 never in room3 when ball4? It's at room4. So constraints satisfied. Also ensure robot1 never in room3: we can keep robot1 at room4 or move to room2 or room1 but avoid room3. Let's keep robot1 at room4 throughout. No actions for robot1 needed. So plan only uses robot2. Ensure robot2 never in room3 when picking ball4? Not relevant. Also ensure robot2 never in room3 when picking ball4? ball4 at room4. So fine.
Check constraints: only constraint is always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). Since robot1 never moves, it's satisfied.
Also ensure no other invariants: domain has no constraints except that. So plan is valid.
Let's list steps:
1. pick robot2 ball3 room2 rgripper2
2. move robot2 room2 room3
3. drop robot2 ball3 room3 rgripper2
4. pick robot2 ball4 room4 rgripper
