commentary# The user has provided a PDDL domain and problem. The domain is "gripper-strips" with typing,
# predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
# Actions: move, pick, drop with their parameters, preconditions, effects.
# The problem "gripper-2-4-3" has:
#   - robots: robot1, robot2
#   - grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2
#   - rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4
#   - objects (balls): ball1, ball2, ball3
# Initial state:
#   - robot1 at room3
#   - robot1 free rgripper1
#   - robot1 free lgripper1
#   - robot2 at room2
#   - robot2 free rgripper2
#   - robot2 free lgripper2
#   - ball1 at room1
#   - ball2 at room4
#   - ball3 at room4
# Goal:
#   - ball1 at room4
#   - ball2 at room2
#   - ball3 at room1
# Constraints:
#   - always (not (at-robby robot1 room4))
# So robot1 must never be in room4 at any time. This is a PDDL3 constraint (always).
#
# The user wants a plan that satisfies the goal and the constraint. They also gave output requirements:
# - Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
# - Each line must follow the format: (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
# - Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
# - No explanations, comments, headers.
# - Not PDDL2 or PDDL3; but they said: "If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task."
# So we must produce a plan that satisfies the PDDL3 constraint: robot1 must never be in room4.
#
# Let's analyze the goal requirements for balls:
# - ball1 must go from room1 to room4.
# - ball2 must go from room4 to room2.
# - ball3 must go from room
