analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: (and (at ball1 room3) (at ball2 room3) (at ball3 room4))
Initial state: robot1 at room2, robot2 at room1. Both robots free on both grippers. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room2.
We need to move ball1 to room3 (already there), ball2 to room3, ball3 to room4.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
Constraints: always not both robots at room4 simultaneously. So they cannot both be at room4 at same time.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies goal and constraint.
We need to output plan steps, each line: action name and parameters.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to consider that robots can move between rooms.
We need to ensure that at the end, ball1 at room3 (already), ball2 at room3, ball3 at room4.
We can use robot1 or robot2 to move objects.
We need to avoid both robots at room4 simultaneously.
Let's design plan.
Initial: robot1 at room2, robot2 at room1.
Objects: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room3 (already), ball2 at room3, ball3 at room4.
We need to move ball2 from room4 to room3, ball3 from room2 to room4.
We can use robot1 to pick ball3 at room2, move to room4, drop. But robot1 is at room2 initially, so can pick ball3.
Robot1 can pick ball3 at room2, then move to room4, drop ball3 at room4.
But we also need to move ball2 from room4 to room3. We can use robot2 to pick ball2 at room4, move to room3, drop.
But we must ensure that at no time both robots are at room4 simultaneously. So we need to coordinate.
Let's propose plan:
