analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room3
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room1
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room4
- at ball3 room1
- at ball4 room1
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room4
- at ball4 room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to move ball2 to room2, ball3 to room4, ball1 and ball4 remain at room1. Robot1 starts at room3, robot2 at room1. We need to plan actions to achieve goal.
We can use either robot to move objects. But robot1 cannot be at room4. So robot2 must move ball2 to room2 and ball3 to room4. But robot2 starts at room1. It can move to room2 or
