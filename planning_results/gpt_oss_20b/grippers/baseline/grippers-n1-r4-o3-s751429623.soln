analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms 1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4.
Constraints: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b rgripper1))). So robot1 cannot carry any object with rgripper1. So robot1 must use lgripper1 to carry objects.
Thus we need to plan to move robot to appropriate rooms, pick up objects with lgripper1, drop them at target rooms.
We need to ensure that at each step, robot1 is at the correct room, and free robot1 lgripper1 when picking.
We also need to ensure that robot1 never carries with rgripper1. So we must never use rgripper1 to carry. But we can still use rgripper1 to pick? Wait pick requires free robot1 rgripper1. But constraint says robot1 cannot carry with rgripper1. But pick action uses free robot1 rgripper1. That is allowed. But after pick, carry robot1 object rgripper1 would violate constraint. So we must never pick with rgripper1. So we must use lgripper1 for all picks.
Thus plan: robot1 moves to room3
