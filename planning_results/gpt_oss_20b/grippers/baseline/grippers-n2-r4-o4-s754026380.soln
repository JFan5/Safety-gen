analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: (and (at ball1 room4) (at ball2 room1) (at ball3 room3) (at ball4 room3))
Initial state: robot1 at room3; robot2 at room2. Both robots free in both grippers. Objects: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1, ball4 at room3.
Constraints: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to move objects to goal positions. Let's see current positions: ball1 at room4 already goal; ball2 at room2 but goal is room1; ball3 at room1 but goal is room3; ball4 at room3 already goal.
So we need to move ball2 from room2 to room1, and ball3 from room1 to room3. Robot1 starts at room3, robot2 at room2. Robot1 cannot go to room4. But robot1 can move to other rooms. Robot2 can move anywhere.
We need to plan moves to achieve goal.
We need to consider that robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time. So robot1 cannot move to room4. But robot2 can.
We need to move ball2 from room2 to room1. Robot2 is at room2 initially, so can pick ball2. But ball2 is at room2, goal is room1. So robot2 can pick ball2, move to room1, drop it. But robot2 cannot be at room4? No constraint on robot2. So robot2 can move to room1.
Similarly, ball3 is at room1, goal is room3. Robot1 is at room3 initially. But robot1 cannot be at room4. But ball3 is at room1, goal is room3. Robot1 is at room3, but ball3 is at room1. Robot1 cannot pick ball3 because it's not at same room. Robot2 can pick ball3? Robot2 is at room2 initially. But ball3 is at room1. So robot2 must move to room
