analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot r, from, to. Precondition: at-robby r from. Effect: at-robby r to, not at-robby r from.
pick: robot r, object obj, room, gripper g. Precondition: at obj room, at-robby r room, free r g. Effect: carry r obj g, not at obj room, not free r g.
drop: robot r, object obj, room, gripper g. Precondition: carry r obj g, at-robby r room. Effect: at obj room, free r g, not carry r obj g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room3
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room2
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room1
- ball2 at room4
- ball3 at room4
Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room4)). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms, respecting constraint that robot1 never at room4.
We can use robot2 to move to room4 if needed. Robot1 cannot be at room4.
We need to move ball1 from room1 to room4. ball2 from room4 to room2. ball3 from room4 to room1.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
We need to ensure that robot1 never at room4. So robot1 can move to other rooms but not room4.
Robot2 can move to room4.
We need to move ball1 to room4. ball2 to room2. ball3 to
