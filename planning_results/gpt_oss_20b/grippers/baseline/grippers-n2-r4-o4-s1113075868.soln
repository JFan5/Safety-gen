analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in same room, with free gripper. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room4
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room1
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room4
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room4
- ball4 at room1
Goal:
- ball1 at room4
- ball2 at room2
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraints.
We have two robots. They can pick and drop objects. They can move between rooms. They cannot be at room3 at any time.
Goal: ball1 at room4 (already at room4 initially). ball2 at room2. ball3 at room1. ball4 at room1.
Currently ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1. So we
