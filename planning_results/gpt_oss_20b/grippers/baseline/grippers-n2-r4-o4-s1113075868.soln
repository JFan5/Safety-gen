analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: at ball1 room4, ball2 room2, ball3 room1, ball4 room1.
Initial: robot1 at room4, robot2 at room1. Both robots free in both grippers. ball1 at room4, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room1.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to move balls to goal positions. Let's see current positions: ball1 at room4 (goal), ball3 at room4 (goal). ball2 at room1, goal room2. ball4 at room1, goal room1 (already). So only ball2 needs to be moved from room1 to room2. But ball2 is at room1, goal at room2. So we need to move robot(s) to pick ball2 and drop at room2.
We have two robots: robot1 at room4, robot2 at room1. Robot2 is at room1, same as ball2. So robot2 can pick ball2 and drop at room2. But we need to move robot2 to room2. But robot2 is at room1. So we need to move robot2 to room2. But we must ensure robot2 can move to room2. There's no constraint on robot2. So we can move robot2 from room1 to room2. But we need to ensure that robot2 can move to room2. The move action requires at-robby robot at from room. So we can do move robot2 room1 room2. But we need to ensure that robot2 is free in both grippers. Initially free. So we can pick ball2 at room1, then move to room2, drop ball2.
But we must also ensure that robot1 never goes to room3. That is fine.
We also need to ensure that robot1 remains at room4. It can stay there.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Let's produce plan steps:
1. pick robot2 ball2 room1 lgripper1 (or
