analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Init: robot1 at room2; free robot1 rgripper1; free robot1 lgripper1; robot2 at room2; free robot2 rgripper2; free robot2 lgripper2; ball1 at room1; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room2.
Goal: all balls at room1.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to move ball3 from room2 to room1. ball1 and ball2 already at room1. So we need to move robot1 or robot2 to pick ball3 and drop at room1.
But robot1 cannot be at room3. But we can move robot1 to room1 via room2? Wait robot1 starts at room2. To pick ball3 at room2, robot1 is already there. So robot1 can pick ball3 and drop at room1. But robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time. That's fine.
We need to ensure that robot1 doesn't go to room3. So we can just move robot1 from room2 to room1 directly? But there is no direct move from room2 to room1? The move action requires from and to rooms. We can move from room2 to room1 directly if we specify move
