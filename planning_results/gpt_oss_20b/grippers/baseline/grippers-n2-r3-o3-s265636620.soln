analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state: robot1 at room1, free rgripper1, free lgripper1. robot2 at room2, free rgripper2, free lgripper2. ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room1.
Constraints: always not (at-robby robot1 room2 and at-robby robot2 room2). So they cannot both be at room2 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls accordingly while respecting constraints.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room1 to room2, ball2 from room2 to room1, ball3 from room2 to room1. So basically swap ball1 with ball2 and ball3.
We need to ensure that at any time, robot1 and robot2 are not both at room2 simultaneously.
We can plan: robot1 picks ball1 at room1, moves to room2, drops ball1. robot2 picks ball2 and ball3 at room2, moves to room1, drops them.
But we need to ensure that robot2 does not stay at room2 while robot1 also at room2. So we can
