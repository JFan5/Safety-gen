analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: parameters (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
precondition: (at-robby ?r ?from)
effect: (at-robby ?r ?to) and not (at-robby ?r ?from)
pick: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: (at ?obj ?room) (at-robby ?r ?room) (free ?r ?g)
effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g
drop: parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object ?room - room ?g - gripper)
precondition: (carry ?r ?obj ?g) (at-robby ?r ?room)
effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room4
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room3
Goal:
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room3
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3))
So robot1 must never be in room3.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room2. ball2 and ball3 already at room3, goal satisfied.
We need to plan actions for robot1 and robot2 to move ball1 to room2. Robot1 starts at room1, robot2 at room
