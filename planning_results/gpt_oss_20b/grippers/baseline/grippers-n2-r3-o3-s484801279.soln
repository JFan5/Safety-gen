analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks up object. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1, room2, room3; objects: ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room2
Goal:
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 must never be in room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball2 and ball3 to room1, while ball1 stays at room3. Robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. Robot2 can be in any room.
We need to use grippers to pick up objects and drop them. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects with either gr
