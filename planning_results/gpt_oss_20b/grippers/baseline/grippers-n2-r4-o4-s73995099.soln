analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: at ball1 room2, ball2 room3, ball3 room1, ball4 room1.
Initial state: robot1 at room3; robot2 at room2. Both robots free in both grippers. ball1 at room2; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room3.
We need to move balls to goal positions.
Constraints: never both robots at room1 simultaneously; never both at room3 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that robots can move between rooms, pick up objects, drop them.
We have 4 balls: ball1 at room2 (goal same), ball2 at room1 (goal room3), ball3 at room3 (goal room1), ball4 at room3 (goal room1). So we need to move ball2 from room1 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room1, ball4 from room3 to room1. ball1 stays at room2.
We have two robots: robot1 at room3, robot2 at room2. They can pick up objects.
We need to avoid both robots being in same room at same time: cannot both be at room1 or room3 simultaneously. So we must schedule movements accordingly.
We need to produce a plan: sequence of actions.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to consider that each robot has two grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1 for robot1; rgripper2, lgripper2 for robot2.
We can pick up objects with either gripper.
We need to move objects to goal rooms.
Let's think of a plan.
Goal: ball2 to room3, ball3 to room1, ball4 to room1.
We can use robot1 to pick up ball3 and ball4 from room3 and drop them at room1. Robot2 can pick up ball2 from room1 and drop at room3.
But we must ensure constraints: never both robots at room1 or room3 simultaneously.
Robot1 starts at room3. Robot2 at room2.
We can
