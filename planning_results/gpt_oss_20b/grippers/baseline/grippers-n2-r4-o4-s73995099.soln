analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. We have two robots robot1 and robot2, each with two grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1 for robot1; rgripper2, lgripper2 for robot2. Rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4. Objects: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room3
- robot1's rgripper1 free, lgripper1 free
- robot2 at room2
- robot2's rgripper2 free, lgripper2 free
- ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room3
- ball4 at room3
Goal:
- ball1 at room2 (already)
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Constraints: never both robots at room1 simultaneously; never both at room3 simultaneously.
We need to move balls to goal positions.
We can use robots to pick and drop.
We need to plan actions: pick, drop, move.
We need to ensure constraints: never both robots at same room1 or room3 at same time.
We can plan: robot1 at room3 initially. robot2 at room2.
Goal: ball2 from room1 to room3. ball3 from room3 to room1. ball4 from room3 to room1.
We can use robot1 to move ball3 and ball4 to room1. robot2 can move ball2 to room3.
But we must avoid both robots at same room1 or room3 simultaneously.
Let's design plan:
Initial: robot1 at room3, robot2 at room2.
We can move robot1 to room1? But constraint: never both at room1 simultaneously. If robot1 moves to room1, robot2 must not be there. Robot2 is at room2, so fine. But robot1 moving to room1 might conflict with robot2 moving to room3? Let's plan.
We need to move ball3 and ball4 from room3 to room1. Robot1 can pick them up and drop at room1. But we need to pick both balls. Robot1 has two grippers. It can pick ball3 with one gripper, ball4 with the other. But we need to drop them at room1. But
