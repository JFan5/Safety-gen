analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room2
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room3
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room4
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room4.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots. They can move between rooms. They can pick and drop objects. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick objects with either gripper.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room1. ball2 already at room3 (goal). ball3 from room1 to room4. ball4 from room1 to room4.
So we need to move ball3 and ball4 to room4. They start at room1. So we need to pick them up and drop at room4.
We have two robots. We can use robot1 or robot2. But robot1 cannot be at room3
