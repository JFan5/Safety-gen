analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot r, from, to. Precondition: at-robby r from. Effect: at-robby r to, not at-robby r from.
pick: robot r, object obj, room room, gripper g. Precondition: at obj room, at-robby r room, free r g. Effect: carry r obj g, not at obj room, not free r g.
drop: robot r, object obj, room room, gripper g. Precondition: carry r obj g, at-robby r room. Effect: at obj room, free r g, not carry r obj g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room4
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room4
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room3
- ball2 at room3
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Goal: ball1 at room2; ball2 at room3; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room3.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots. They can move between rooms. They can pick up objects with grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects with either gripper.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room3, ball4 at room3.
Initial: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room1, ball4 at room1.
So ball1 already at room3 but goal wants at room2. So need to move ball1 from room3 to room2. ball2
