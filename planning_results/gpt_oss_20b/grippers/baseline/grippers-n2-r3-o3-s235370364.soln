analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1 room2 room3, objects ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room1
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room3
Goal:
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room2
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 must never be in room3.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball2 from room2 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room2, while ball1 stays at room3. Robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time. Robot2 can be in any room.
We need to use grippers to pick and drop objects. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick objects with either gripper.
