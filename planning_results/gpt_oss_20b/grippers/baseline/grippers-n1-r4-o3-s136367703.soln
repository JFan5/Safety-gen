analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms 1-4, objects ball1-3.
Initial: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2.
Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b rgripper1))) meaning robot1 cannot carry any object with rgripper1. So robot1 can only use lgripper1 to carry objects. So we must ensure that robot1 never carries with rgripper1. So we can only use lgripper1 for carrying.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room2, ball1 stays at room2. So we need to pick ball2 from room1, move robot to room3, drop ball2. Then pick ball3 from room3, move robot to room2, drop ball3. But we must ensure that robot1 never carries with rgripper1. So we must use lgripper1 for carrying.
We also need to ensure that at each step, the robot's gripper is free before picking. Initially both grippers are free. So we can pick ball2 with lgripper1.
Sequence:
1. pick robot1 ball2 room1 lgripper1
2. move robot1 room1
