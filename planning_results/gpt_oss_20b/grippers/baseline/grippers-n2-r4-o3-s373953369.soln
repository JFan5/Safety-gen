analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1-4, objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room4
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room3
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room2
Goal: at ball1 room2, at ball2 room1, at ball3 room2.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball1 to room2, ball2 to room1, ball3 stays at room2. Initially ball2 and ball3 are at room2. So ball2 and ball3 already at room2. But goal requires ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2. So ball2 must be moved to room1. ball1 must be moved to room2. ball3 stays at room2.
We need to move robot1 or robot2 to pick and drop objects.
We have two robots. Robot1 starts at room4. Robot2 starts at room2. Robot1 can move to other rooms except cannot be at room3. So robot1 cannot go to room3. But robot
