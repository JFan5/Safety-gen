analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room2
- at ball4 room1
Initial state:
- robot1 at room2
- robot1 free rgripper1, lgripper1
- robot2 at room4
- robot2 free rgripper2, lgripper2
- ball1 at room1
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room3
- ball4 at room4
Constraints: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
Goal requires ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2. So we need to move robot1 or robot2 to deliver them.
We need to plan actions.
We have two robots: robot1 and robot2. They can move between rooms. They can pick up objects with grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can carry objects.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room3. ball3 from room3 to room2. ball4 from room4 to room1. ball1 stays at room1.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can.
We need to deliver ball2 to room3. We can use robot2 to pick ball2 from room1, move to room3, drop. But robot2 starts at room4. It can move to room1? Wait, robot2 at room4. It can move to room1? It can move to any room via move action. But we need to ensure robot2 can get to room1. There's no constraint on robot2. So robot2 can move to room1, pick ball2, move to room3, drop.
Similarly, ball3 from room3 to room2. Robot2 can pick ball3 from room3, move to room2, drop. But robot2 cannot be at room3? There's no constraint on robot2. So robot2 can be at room3.
But we need
