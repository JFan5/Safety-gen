analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks object in same room, with free gripper. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1 room2 room3 room4, objects: ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room4
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
Goal: at ball1 room1, ball2 room2, ball3 room3.
Constraints: always not (at-robby robot1 room3 and at-robby robot2 room3). So they cannot both be in room3 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room1, ball2 from room3 to room2, ball3 from room4 to room3.
We need to ensure that at no point both robots are in room3 simultaneously.
We can plan a sequence.
We need to consider that robots start at
