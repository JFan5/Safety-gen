analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms: room1-4, objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room1
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room1
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room1
- ball3 at room3
- ball4 at room2
Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room2, ball4 at room1.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms.
We need to move ball1 from room2 to room1, ball2 already at room1, ball3 from room3 to room2, ball4 from room2 to room1.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. Robot2 can.
We need to plan moves.
We can use robot2 to move to room3 to pick ball3, then drop at room2. Robot1 can handle others.
We need to ensure at each step constraints satisfied.
Let's design plan.
