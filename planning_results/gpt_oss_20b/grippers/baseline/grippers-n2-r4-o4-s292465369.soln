analysisWe need to produce a plan for the gripper problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move: robot moves from room to room if at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby at from.
pick: robot picks object in room if at-robby robot at room, object at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room if carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial: robot1 at room1; robot2 at room1. Both free all grippers. ball1 at room2; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room1; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room2; ball4 at room1.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room3). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room2 to room1; ball2 already at room1; ball3 from room3 to room2; ball4 from room2 to room1.
We must avoid robot1 being at room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can.
We need to plan moves.
We can use robot1 to pick ball1 from room2 and drop at room1. But robot1 cannot be at room3. That's fine.
Robot1 can move from room1 to room2, pick ball1, drop at room1. But robot1 cannot be at room3. So we can avoid that.
Robot2 can move to room3 to pick ball3 and drop at room2.
We need to ensure that robot1 never
