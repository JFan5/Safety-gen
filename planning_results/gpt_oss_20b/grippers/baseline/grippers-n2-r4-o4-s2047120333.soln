analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot r from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby r from. Effect: at-robby r to, not at-robby r from.
pick: robot r, object obj, room, gripper g. Preconditions: at obj room, at-robby r room, free r g. Effect: carry r obj g, not at obj room, not free r g.
drop: robot r, object obj, room, gripper g. Preconditions: carry r obj g, at-robby r room. Effect: at obj room, free r g, not carry r obj g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-4.
Initial state: robot1 at room4, robot2 at room3. Both robots free on both grippers. ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4, ball4 at room3.
Goal: ball1 at room3, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1, ball4 at room4.
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint. Robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time. Robot2 can be at any room.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room3, ball3 from room4 to room1, ball4 already at room3 stays at room3? Wait goal says ball4 at room4. So ball4 must be moved from room3 to room4. ball2 stays at room2.
We need to plan moves.
We have two robots. Each robot has two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room3. So robot1 must avoid moving to room3. Robot2 can move to room3.
We need to move ball1 to room3. Since robot1 cannot be at room3, robot2 must pick ball1
