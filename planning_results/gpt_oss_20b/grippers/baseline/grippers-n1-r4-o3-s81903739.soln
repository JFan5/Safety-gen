analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: robot1 at room4 initially. free robot1 rgripper1 and lgripper1. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room3. Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4. Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b rgripper1))) meaning robot1 cannot carry any object with rgripper1. So robot1 must use lgripper1 to carry objects. So we must ensure that robot1 never carries with rgripper1. So we can only use lgripper1 for carrying.
We need to move robot to pick up ball1 and ball3 from room3 to room4. ball2 already at room2, goal is ball2 at room2, so no action needed for ball2. So we need to move robot to room3, pick ball1 and ball3, drop them at room4. But we must ensure that robot uses lgripper1 for carrying. So we need to pick ball1 with lgripper1, drop at room4, pick ball3 with lgripper1, drop at room4. But we must also ensure that robot can pick both ball1 and ball3 from room3. But robot can only carry one object at a time. So we need to pick ball1, drop at room4, then pick ball3, drop at room4. But we must also ensure that robot can pick ball3 after dropping ball1. But we need to ensure that robot is
