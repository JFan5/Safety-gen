analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. We have robots robot1 and robot2, each with two grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1 for robot1; rgripper2, lgripper2 for robot2. Rooms: room1, room2, room3, room4. Objects: ball1, ball2, ball3, ball4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room1
- robot1's rgripper1 free
- robot1's lgripper1 free
- robot2 at room2
- robot2's rgripper2 free
- robot2's lgripper2 free
- ball1 at room3
- ball2 at room2
- ball3 at room2
- ball4 at room3
Goal:
- ball1 at room1
- ball2 at room2
- ball3 at room4
- ball4 at room4
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions, respecting constraints.
We have two robots, each can carry objects with their grippers. They can move between rooms. They can pick up objects if at same room and gripper free. They can drop objects at same room.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room1. ball2 already at room2 (goal). ball3 from room2 to room4. ball4 from room3 to room4.
We need to ensure robot1 never goes to room3. So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time. But robot1 starts at room1, robot2 at room2. Robot1 can move to room2, room4, etc. But cannot go to room3.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room1. Since robot1 cannot be at room3, robot2 must pick up ball1. Robot2 starts at room2. It can move to room3 to pick up ball1. But robot2 can go to room3. No constraint on robot2. So robot2 can go to room3, pick up ball1, then move to room1 to drop it. But robot2 must travel from room3 to room1. Path: room3 -> room2 -> room1? Actually rooms are just nodes; we
