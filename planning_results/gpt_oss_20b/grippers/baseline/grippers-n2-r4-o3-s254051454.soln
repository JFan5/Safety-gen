analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room2
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room4
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room1
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room3
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves ball2 to room2 and ball3 to room3, while ball1 stays at room1. Robot1 starts at room2, robot2 at room4. Both robots have two grippers each. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to ensure robot1 never goes to room3. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can go to room3
