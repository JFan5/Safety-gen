analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room1.
Initial state: robot1 at room1, robot2 at room2. Both robots free with both grippers. ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room2.
Constraints: always not (at-robby robot1 room2 and at-robby robot2 room2). So they cannot both be at room2 simultaneously. That means we must avoid both robots being at room2 at same time.
We need to move balls to target rooms. Let's think.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room1.
Currently ball1 at room1 (already at target? Wait goal says ball1 at room2). So ball1 needs to be moved to room2. ball2 currently at room2, needs to go to room1. ball3 currently at room2, needs to go to room1.
We can use either robot to move them. Need to avoid both robots at room2 simultaneously.
Let's design plan.
We can have robot1 at room1 initially. Robot2 at room2.
We can have robot1 pick ball1 at room1, carry to room2. But robot1 must move to room2 to drop ball1. But robot2 is at room2 initially. Constraint: cannot have both at room2 simultaneously. So robot1 cannot move to room2 while robot2 is there. So we need to move robot2 away from room2 before robot1 moves to room2.
Robot2 can move to room1 or room3. Let's move robot2 to room1. But room1 currently has robot1. They cannot both be at room1 simultaneously? There's no constraint forbidding that. Constraint only forbids both at room2 simultaneously. So robot2 can move to room1. But robot1 is at room1. They can both be at same room? The constraint only forbids both at room2. So it's okay.
But we need to ensure that robot2
