analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1, robot2; grippers: rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2; rooms: room1-4; objects: ball1-4.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room2
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room3
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room4
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room1
- at ball4 room1
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room4
- at ball4 room4
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be in room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them.
We need to move ball1 from room4 to room1, ball2 stays in room3 (already at goal), ball3 from room1 to room4, ball4 from room
