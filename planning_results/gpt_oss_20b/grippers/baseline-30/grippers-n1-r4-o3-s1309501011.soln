analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper. Predicates: at-robby robot room, at object room, free robot gripper, carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
- move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
- pick: robot picks up object in same room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, grippers rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-3.
Init: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1, ball2, ball3 at room2.
Goal: ball1 at room4, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3.
Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))). So robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1. So robot1 must use rgripper1 to carry objects.
Thus robot1 must pick up objects with rgripper1 only.
We need to plan a sequence of actions to move robot and objects to goal positions.
We need to ensure that at each step, the robot's gripper usage respects constraints: cannot carry with lgripper1. So we must use rgripper1 for all carries.
Also, we must ensure that at any time, robot1 is at a room where it can pick or drop objects.
We need to move ball1 to room4, ball2 to room1, ball3 to room3.
Initial positions: all balls at room2.
Robot starts at room1.
We need to plan a sequence of moves and picks/drops.
We need to consider that robot can carry only one object at a time (since each pick uses a gripper; but we have two grippers: rgripper1 and lgripper1
