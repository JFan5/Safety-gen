analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. We have robots robot1 and robot2, grippers rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2. Rooms room1-4. Objects ball1, ball2, ball3.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions: move, pick, drop.
Goal: (and (at ball1 room3) (at ball2 room3) (at ball3 room4))
Initial state: robot1 at room2, robot2 at room1. Both robots free on all grippers. ball1 at room3, ball2 at room4, ball3 at room2.
We need to move ball1 and ball2 to room3, ball3 to room4.
Constraints: always not (at-robby robot1 room4 and at-robby robot2 room4). So they cannot both be at room4 simultaneously. But they can be at room4 individually.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies goal and constraints.
We need to output plan steps, each line: (<ACTION_NAME> <params>).
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We need to consider that robots can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects if free.
We need to move objects to target rooms.
Goal: ball1 at room3 (already at room3 initially). ball2 at room3 (currently at room4). ball3 at room4 (currently at room2). So we need to move ball2 from room4 to room3, ball3 from room2 to room4.
We can use either robot to pick up and drop.
We need to ensure that at the end, ball1 remains at room3 (unchanged). So we don't need to move ball1.
We need to move ball2 to room3, ball3 to room4.
We need to consider constraints: robots cannot both be at room4 simultaneously. So we must avoid that.
We can plan: robot1 picks ball3 at room2, moves to room4, drops ball3. robot2 picks ball2 at room4, moves to room3, drops ball2. But we must ensure that at no time both robots are at room4 simultaneously
