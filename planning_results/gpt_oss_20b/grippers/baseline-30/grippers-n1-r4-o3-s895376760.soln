analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from one room to another. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
- pick: robot picks up object. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
- drop: robot drops object. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms 1-4, objects ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room2
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room1
Goal:
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room2
- at ball3 room4
Constraints: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b lgripper1))) meaning robot1 cannot carry any object with lgripper1. So robot1 cannot use lgripper1 to carry objects. So only rgripper1 can carry objects.
Thus robot1 must use rgripper1 to carry objects. lgripper1 must remain free.
Goal: ball1 at room1, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room4.
Initial: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room2, ball3 at room1.
We need to move ball1 to room1, ball3 to room4. ball2 stays at room2.
Robot starts at room2. So ball1 is already at room2; we need to move it to room1. ball3 is at room1; need to move to
