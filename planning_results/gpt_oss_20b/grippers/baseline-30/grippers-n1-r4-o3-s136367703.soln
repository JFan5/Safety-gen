analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1, rgripper1, lgripper1, rooms 1-4, objects ball1, ball2, ball3.
Initial: robot1 at room1. free robot1 rgripper1, free robot1 lgripper1. ball1 at room2, ball2 at room1, ball3 at room3.
Goal: ball1 at room2, ball2 at room3, ball3 at room2.
Constraint: always (forall (?b - object) (not (carry robot1 ?b rgripper1))). Means robot1 cannot carry any object with rgripper1. So robot1 must use lgripper1 to carry objects. So we cannot use rgripper1 to carry anything. So we must use lgripper1 for all picks/drops.
We need to move ball2 from room1 to room3, ball3 from room3 to room2, ball1 stays at room2. So we need to pick ball2 at room1, move robot to room3, drop ball2 at room3. Then pick ball3 at room3, move robot to room2, drop ball3 at room2. But we also need to ensure robot ends at some location? Not required. Just satisfy goal.
We must ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We also must ensure that robot1 never carries with rgripper1. So we must always use lgripper1.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
Let's outline:
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
