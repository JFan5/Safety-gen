analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
- move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby ?r ?from. Effect: at-robby ?r ?to, not at-robby ?r ?from.
- pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at ?obj ?room, at-robby ?r ?room, free ?r ?g. Effect: carry ?r ?obj ?g, not at ?obj ?room, not free ?r ?g.
- drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry ?r ?obj ?g, at-robby ?r ?room. Effect: at ?obj ?room, free ?r ?g, not carry ?r ?obj ?g.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1 room2 room3, objects ball1 ball2 ball3.
Initial state:
- at-robby robot1 room1
- free robot1 rgripper1
- free robot1 lgripper1
- at-robby robot2 room2
- free robot2 rgripper2
- free robot2 lgripper2
- at ball1 room1
- at ball2 room1
- at ball3 room2
Goal:
- at ball1 room2
- at ball2 room3
- at ball3 room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to target rooms, using robots and grippers, respecting constraints.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms. The constraint prohibits robot1 from being at room3 at any time. So robot1 cannot move to room3. But robot2 can.
Goal: ball1 to room2, ball2 to room3,
