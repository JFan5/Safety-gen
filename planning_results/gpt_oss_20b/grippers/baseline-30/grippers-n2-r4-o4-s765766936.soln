analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates: at-robby robot room; at object room; free robot gripper; carry robot object gripper.
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot from. Effect: at-robby robot to, not at-robby robot from.
pick: robot picks object in room. Preconditions: at object room, at-robby robot room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot room. Effect: at object room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2; grippers: rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2; rooms: room1 room2 room3 room4; objects: ball1 ball2 ball3 ball4.
Initial state: robot1 at room3; robot2 at room3. Both robots free with both grippers. ball1 at room3; ball2 at room3; ball3 at room4; ball4 at room4.
Goal: ball1 at room1; ball2 at room1; ball3 at room3; ball4 at room3.
Constraint: always not (at-robby robot1 room4). So robot1 cannot be at room4 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots, each with two grippers. They can pick up objects and drop them. They can move between rooms.
We need to move ball1 and ball2 from room3 to room1. ball3 and ball4 from room4 to room3.
We need to ensure robot1 never at room4. So robot1 cannot move to room4. But robot2 can.
We need to plan moves.
We need to consider that each robot can carry at most one object per gripper. They can pick up objects with free gripper.
We need to plan sequence of actions.
We need to output plan lines: action name and parameters.
We need to ensure all preconditions hold.
We need to consider that at-robby robot1 room3 initially. robot2
