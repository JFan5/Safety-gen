analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: gripper-strips. Types: room, object, robot, gripper.
Predicates:
- at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room
- at ?o - object ?x - room
- free ?r - robot ?g - gripper
- carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper
Actions:
move: robot moves from room to room. Preconditions: at-robby robot at from. Effect: at-robby robot at to, not at-robby robot at from.
pick: robot picks up object in same room. Preconditions: at object at room, at-robby robot at room, free robot gripper. Effect: carry robot object gripper, not at object at room, not free robot gripper.
drop: robot drops object in same room. Preconditions: carry robot object gripper, at-robby robot at room. Effect: at object at room, free robot gripper, not carry robot object gripper.
Problem: objects: robot1 robot2, grippers rgripper1 lgripper1 rgripper2 lgripper2, rooms room1-4, objects ball1-4.
Initial state:
- robot1 at room1
- robot1 free rgripper1, free lgripper1
- robot2 at room2
- robot2 free rgripper2, free lgripper2
- ball1 at room3
- ball2 at room4
- ball3 at room4
- ball4 at room3
Goal:
- ball1 at room2
- ball2 at room4
- ball3 at room1
- ball4 at room1
Constraint: always (not (at-robby robot1 room3)). So robot1 cannot be at room3 at any time.
We need to produce a plan that moves the balls to goal positions while respecting constraint.
We have two robots. They can carry objects using grippers. Each robot has two grippers: rgripper and lgripper. They can pick up objects if free. They can carry objects.
We need to move ball1 from room3 to room2. ball2 stays at room4 (goal same as initial). ball3 from room4 to room1. ball4 from room3 to room1.
We need to plan moves for robots.
