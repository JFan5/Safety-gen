analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's parse the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b2
- on-table b2
- on-table b3
- on b4 b3
- on b5 b1
- on b6 b5
- clear b4
- clear b6
Goal:
- on-table b1
- on b2 b3
- on b3 b4
- on b4 b6
- on-table b5
- on b6 b1
Constraints: (sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on-table b1))
Interpretation: The action sequence must satisfy that at some point before the goal, the state (on b2 b3) must occur before (on-table b1). Actually "sometime-before" means that the state (on b2 b3) must occur before the state (on-table b1) in the plan. So we need to ensure that at some point before the final state, we have on b2 b3, and later we have on-table b1. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
Goal states: on-table b1, on b2 b3, on b3 b4, on b4 b6, on-table b5, on b6 b1.
We need to produce a plan that achieves all these.
Let's analyze initial configuration:
- b1 on b2
- b2 on-table
- b3 on-table
- b4 on b3
- b5 on b1
- b6 on b5
- clear b4
- clear b6
So initial stack: b2 on-table, b1 on b2, b5 on b1, b6 on b5. b4 on b3. b3 on-table. b4 clear, b6 clear.
Goal: We want b1 on-table, b2 on b3, b3 on b4, b4 on b6, b5 on-table, b6 on b1.
So final arrangement: b1 on-table, b2 on b3, b3 on b4, b4 on b6, b5 on-table, b6 on b1. That seems like a chain:
