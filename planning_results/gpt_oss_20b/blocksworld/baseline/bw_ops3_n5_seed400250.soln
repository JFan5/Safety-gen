analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b5
- on b2 b4
- on b3 b2
- on-table b4
- on b5 b3
- clear b1
So initial configuration: Let's draw.
b5 is on b3. b3 is on b2. b2 is on b4. b4 is on table. b1 is on b5. So stack: table -> b4 -> b2 -> b3 -> b5 -> b1. Wait check: on b5 b3 means b5 is on b3. So b5 is on top of b3. b3 is on b2. So b3 is on top of b2. b2 is on b4. b4 is on table. So yes.
Also clear b1: b1 has no block on top of it. So b1 is on top of b5. So b1 is clear.
Goal:
- on-table b1
- on-table b2
- on b3 b4
- on b4 b2
- on b5 b3
So we need to achieve that b1 and b2 are on table, b3 on b4, b4 on b2, b5 on b3. So final arrangement: table -> b2 -> b4 -> b3 -> b5 -> b1? Wait check: on b4 b2 means b4 is on b2. on b3 b4 means b3 is on b4. on b5 b3 means b5 is on b3. So final stack: table -> b2 -> b4 -> b3 -> b5 -> b1. But also on-table b1 and on-table b2. Wait goal says on-table b1 and on-table b2. That means b1 and b2 are on table. But also on b4 b2 means b4 is on b2. So b2 must be on table. So final arrangement: table -> b2 -> b4 -> b3 -> b5 -> b1. But also on-table b1 means b1 is on table. But in that arrangement, b1 is on top of b5. So b1
