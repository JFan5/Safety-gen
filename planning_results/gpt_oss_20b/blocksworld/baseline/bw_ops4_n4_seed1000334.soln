analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b3 b4) (on b1 b2)". The goal: (on b1 b2) AND (on b3 b4) AND (on b4 b1). Wait, goal includes (on b4 b1). So final state must have b4 on b1. Also (on b3 b4) must hold. And (on b1 b2) must hold. And constraint: sometime-before (on b3 b4) (on b1 b2). That means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b4) must have been true before (on b1 b2) becomes true. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that at some point before achieving (on b1 b2), (on b3 b4) was true. But the goal includes (on b3 b4) as well, so we can satisfy by having (on b3 b4) true earlier, then later (on b1 b2). But we also need (on b4 b1) true at the end. So we need to plan accordingly.
Let's analyze initial state:
Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4.
Initial facts:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on-table b2
- on b3 b4
- on-table b4
- clear b1
- clear b2
- clear b3
Wait: "on b3 b4" means b3 is on b4. So b3 is on b4. Also on-table b4 means b4 is on table. So b3 on b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table. So b3 is on b4, b4 on table
