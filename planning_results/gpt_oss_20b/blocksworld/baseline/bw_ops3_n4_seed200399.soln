analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b4
- on b2 b1
- on b3 b2
- on-table b4
- clear b3
Goal:
- on b1 b2
- on-table b2
- on b3 b4
- on-table b4
Constraints: (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b2))
Interpretation: The constraint says that at some point before the goal, the state (on-table b2) must hold before (on b1 b2). Wait: The constraint is "sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b2)". Means that at some point before the goal, the state (on-table b2) must hold before (on b1 b2). Actually, the semantics: "sometime-before P Q" means that at some point in the plan, P holds before Q holds. So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the state (on-table b2) holds before the state (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both (on b1 b2) and (on-table b2). So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, (on-table b2) holds, and then later (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the plan includes a state where (on-table b2) holds before (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the plan includes a state where (on-table b2) holds before (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the plan includes a state where (on-table b2) holds before (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the plan includes a state where (on-table b2) holds before (on b1 b2) holds. But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the plan includes a state where (on-table b2) holds before (on b1 b2) holds. But
