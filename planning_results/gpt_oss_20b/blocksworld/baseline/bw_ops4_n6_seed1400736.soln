analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b6)". That means at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b2) must hold before (on b1 b6) holds. But the goal requires both on b1 b6 and on b3 b2 simultaneously. The constraint says that at some point before achieving on b1 b6, the state on b3 b2 must have held. So we need to ensure that at some point before the final state, we have on b3 b2. But the goal also requires on b3 b2. So we can satisfy by having on b3 b2 earlier, then later on b1 b6. But the goal also requires on b3 b2, so we need to keep it until the end. But if we have on b3 b2 earlier, we must keep it until the end. But we might need to move b3 onto b2 at some point, then later move b1 onto b6. But we must ensure that on b3 b2 holds at some point before on b1 b6. But the goal also requires on b3 b2, so we can just have it hold at the end. But the constraint requires that at some point before on b1 b6, on b3 b2 holds. That could be at the end if on b1 b6 holds after on b3 b2. But the constraint is "sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b6)". That means there exists a time t1 where on b3 b2 holds, and a later time t2 where on b1 b6 holds, with t1 < t2. So we need to ensure that on b3 b2 holds at some earlier time. But the goal requires on b3 b2 at the end. So we can just have on b3 b2 hold at the end, but we need to ensure that on b1 b6 holds after that. So we can have on b3 b2 hold at the end, then on b1 b6 hold after that. But the constraint says "sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b6)". That means on b3 b2 must hold before on b1 b6. So we need to ensure that on b3 b2
