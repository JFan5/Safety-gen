analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on b1 b4)". The goal: (and (on b1 b4) (on b2 b3) (on b3 b1) (on-table b4)). Wait, goal includes (on b3 b1) and (on b1 b4) and (on b2 b3) and (on-table b4). That seems contradictory: on b3 b1 and on b1 b4 means b3 on b1, b1 on b4. So stack: b3 on b1 on b4. Also on b2 b3 means b2 on b3. So final configuration: b2 on b3, b3 on b1, b1 on b4. And b4 on table. So final stack: b4 on table, b1 on b4, b3 on b1, b2 on b3. That is a stack of four blocks: b4 bottom, then b1, then b3, then b2 on top. Wait, but goal also includes (on-table b4). So b4 on table. Good.
Initial state: (arm-empty), (on b1 b3), (on-table b2), (on-table b3), (on b4 b2), (clear b1), (clear b4). Let's parse: initial: b1 on b3, b2 on table, b3 on table, b4 on b2. So stack: b2 on table, b4 on b2. So b4 on b2 on table. b1 on b3 on table. So b3 on table, b1 on b3. So initial configuration: b4 on b2 on table; b1 on b3 on table. So b2 on table, b4 on b2. b3 on table, b1 on b3. So we need to transform to final: b4 on table, b1 on b4, b3 on b1, b2 on b3. So we need to move b4 onto table (already on b2). We need to move b4 onto table? Actually final requires b4 on table. Currently b4 on b2. So we need to unstack b4 from b2, put it on table. Then we need to stack b1 onto b4
