analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's analyze the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. Predicates: clear, on-table, arm-empty, holding, on.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b3
- on b2 b5
- on b3 b6
- on-table b4
- on b5 b4
- on-table b6
- clear b1
- clear b2
Goal:
- on b1 b4
- on-table b2
- on b3 b1
- on-table b4
- on-table b5
- on b6 b2
Constraints: (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b4))
Interpretation: The action (on-table b2) must occur before (on b1 b4). That is, the state where b2 is on-table must happen before the state where b1 is on b4. But the goal includes both conditions: on-table b2 and on b1 b4. So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving on b1 b4, we have b2 on-table. But the goal also requires b2 on-table. So we need to achieve on-table b2 first, then later achieve on b1 b4. But the goal also includes on-table b4 and on-table b5 and on b6 b2. Wait, goal includes on-table b4 and on-table b5. But we also need to satisfy constraints.
Let's analyze initial state:
- b1 on b3
- b2 on b5
- b3 on b6
- b4 on-table
- b5 on b4
- b6 on-table
- clear b1
- clear b2
So initial state: b1 is on b3, b3 on b6, b2 on b5, b5 on b4, b4 on-table, b6 on-table. Clear b1 and clear b2.
Goal:
- on b1 b4
- on-table b2
- on b3 b1
- on-table b4
- on-table b5
- on b6 b2
We need to achieve these.
Let's think of a plan.
We need to end with b
