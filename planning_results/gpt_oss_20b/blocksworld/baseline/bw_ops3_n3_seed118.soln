analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's parse the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1, b2, b3.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on b2 b1
- on b3 b2
- clear b3
Thus initial configuration: b1 on table, b2 on b1, b3 on b2. So stack: b3 on top of b2 on top of b1 on table. b3 is clear. b2 is not clear because b3 on it. b1 is not clear because b2 on it. So clear b3 only.
Goal: (and (on-table b1) (on-table b2) (on b3 b2))
Goal wants b1 on table, b2 on table, and b3 on b2. Wait, but initial has b2 on b1, b3 on b2. So goal wants b2 on table, but currently b2 is on b1. So we need to move b2 to table. Also want b3 on b2, which is already true initially. So we need to move b2 from on b1 to on-table. But we also need to keep b3 on b2. So we need to unstack b2 from b1, put it on table, then stack b3 on b2? But b3 is already on b2. So we need to unstack b2, put it on table, then stack b3 on b2? But b3 is on b2 already, so no need to stack. But after unstacking b2, b3 remains on b2. So final state: b2 on table, b3 on b2, b1 on table. That satisfies goal.
But we must also satisfy constraint: (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on-table b1)). That means at some point before the plan ends, b2 must be on table before b1 is on table? Wait, "sometime-before (on-table b2) (on-table b1)" means that at some point in the plan, (on-table b2) must occur before (on-table b1). So we need to ensure that at some point, b2 is on table before b1 is on table. But initial state has b1 on
