analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b3)". That means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b3 b2) must occur before (on b1 b3). Wait: The constraint is "sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b3)". This means that the state (on b3 b2) must occur before the state (on b1 b3). So we need to ensure that at some point, b3 is on b2 before b1 is on b3. The goal requires (on b1 b3), (on b3 b2), (on b4 b5). So we need to achieve all three. But the constraint says that (on b3 b2) must happen before (on b1 b3). So we need to plan accordingly.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint. We must output only the plan steps, one per line, in the format: (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...). Use only objects defined: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5.
We need to consider initial state: arm-empty, on-table b1, on-table b2, on-table b3, on b4 b3, on b5 b4, clear b1, clear b2, clear b5. So initial state: b4 on b3, b5 on b4. So stack: b5 on b4 on b3. b1, b2, b3 are on table. Clear b1, b2, b5. b3 is on table? Wait, b3 is on table? Actually, (on-table b3) is true. So b3 is on table. But b4 is on b3, so b3 is not clear? Actually, clear b3? The initial state says clear b3? No, clear b3 is not specified. But clear b3 is not in init. So b3 is not clear because b4 is on it. So clear b3 is false. So b3 is not clear. So we cannot pick up b3 until we unstack it from b4. But we need to eventually have b3 on b2. So we need to move b3 onto b2
