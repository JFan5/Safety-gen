commentary# Let's solve the blocksworld instance BW-rand-6 with a PDDL3 constraint:
# (sometime-before (on b4 b3) (on b1 b2))
# Problem details:
# Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6
# Initial state:
# - arm-empty
# - on-table b1
# - on-table b2
# - on b3 b5
# - on-table b4
# - on b5 b6
# - on b6 b4
# - clear b1
# - clear b2
# - clear b3
# (Note: clear b5 and clear b6 are NOT in init, so they are NOT clear initially.
#  From the stack:
#   b3 is on b5 -> so b5 is not clear
#   b5 is on b6 -> so b6 is not clear
#   b6 is on b4 -> so b4 is not clear
#   Also b4 is on-table but not clear because b6 is on it.
#   b2 and b1 are on-table and clear.
#   b4 is on-table but not clear.
# )
# Goal:
# - on b1 b2
# - on b4 b3
# - on b5 b4
# - on b6 b1
# PDDL3 constraint:
# (sometime-before (on b4 b3) (on b1 b2))
# This means: at some point before (on b4 b3) becomes true, (on b1 b2) must be true.
# So (on b1 b2) must be achieved before we stack b4 onto b3.
# After that, (on b1 b2) can be undone if needed, but then it would violate the constraint because (on b4 b3) has already occurred.
# Therefore, once (on b4 b3) is achieved, (on b1 b2) must remain true forever.
# So the final state must have both:
#   on b1 b2
#   on b4 b3
# And (on b1 b2) cannot be removed at any point after that.
# Let's plan step by step, keeping track of:
# - arm status: empty or holding X
# - clear status of each block
# - on-table status
# - goal and
