commentary# The user has provided a PDDL domain and a problem.
# Domain: blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
# Requirements: :strips, :constraints, :negative-preconditions.
# Problem BW-rand-6:
# Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6
# Initial state:
#   arm-empty
#   on b1 b2
#   on b2 b5
#   on b3 b1
#   on-table b4
#   on-table b5
#   on b6 b3
#   clear b4
#   clear b6
# Goal:
#   on-table b1
#   on b2 b4
#   on b3 b6
#   on b4 b3
#   on-table b5
#   on-table b6
# Constraints:
#   (sometime-before (on b2 b4) (on-table b1))
# So we must produce a plan that achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint:
# at some point before (on b2 b4) holds, (on-table b1) must hold.
# That means: when we stack b2 onto b4, b1 must already be on-table.
# In the goal, b1 is on-table, but that could be achieved after b2 is stacked onto b4 unless we plan carefully.
# So we must ensure that before the action stack b2 b4, we have (on-table b1).
# In the initial state, b1 is on b2, so it's not on-table.
# So we need to put b1 onto the table before stacking b2 onto b4.
# Let's analyze the initial configuration:
# Table: b4, b5
# b2 is on b5
# b1 is on b2
# b3 is on b1
# b6 is on b3
# clear: b4, b6
# So the stack structure:
# b5
#  b2
#   b1
#    b3
#     b6
# Table: b4, b5
# Goal configuration:
# Table: b1, b5, b6
# b4 on b3
# b3 on b6
# b2 on b4
# So final stack:
# b6 (table)
#  b3
