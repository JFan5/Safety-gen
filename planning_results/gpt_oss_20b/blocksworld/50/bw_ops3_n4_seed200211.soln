commentaryWe need to produce plan lines. Domain: blocksworld. Problem: BW-rand-4. Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on-table b1
- on-table b2
- on b3 b4
- on-table b4
- clear b1
- clear b2
- clear b3
- (clear b4?) Wait: b3 is on b4, so b4 is not clear. In init, they didn't list clear b4. So clear b4 is false. Also b3 is on b4, so clear b3 is true, clear b4 is false. Also on-table b4, but since b3 is on b4, b4 cannot be on-table. Wait: they have both (on b3 b4) and (on-table b4). That's consistent: b4 is on-table, and b3 is on b4. So clear b4 is false. clear b3 is true. clear b1 true, clear b2 true, clear b4 false.
Goal:
- on-table b1
- on-table b2
- on b3 b2
- on-table b4
So b3 must be stacked on b2. b2 must be on-table. b1 must be on-table. b4 must be on-table. Currently b1 on-table, b2 on-table, b4 on-table, b3 on b4. So only change: move b3 from b4 to b2. Also ensure b2 remains clear? Wait goal: on b3 b2, but doesn't specify clear b2. So b2 can be clear or not. But b3 will be on b2, so clear b2 will become false. Also b4 must be on-table; currently it is on-table, but it's not clear because b3 is on it. So we need to put b3 somewhere else first, then stack on b2. Also need to ensure constraints: PDDL3 constraint: (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on-table b1)). So at some point before (on-table b2) holds, (on-table b1) must hold. In initial state, b1 is on-table, b2 is on-table. So (on-table b2) is true initially, and (on-table b1) is also true initially. The constraint requires that at some point before (
