's internal state contains the blocksworld domain and the specific problem BW-rand-6. The goal is to move block b1 onto block b6, place block b2 on the table, stack block b3 onto block b4, put block b4 onto block b1, keep block b5 on the table, and keep block b6 on the table. Additionally, there is a PDDL3 constraint that requires the goal (on-table b2) to occur sometime before the goal (on b1 b6). The initial state has b1 on the table, b2 on b6, b3 on the table, b4 on b3, b5 on b2, and b6 on the table, with the arm empty. The plan must satisfy all goal conditions and the PDDL3 constraint, maintaining all invariants of the blocksworld domain throughout.)
