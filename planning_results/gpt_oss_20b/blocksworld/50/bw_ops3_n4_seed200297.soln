commentary# Plan Generation for BW-rand-4
# Domain: blocksworld
# Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4
# Initial State:
# - arm-empty
# - on-table b1
# - on b2 b4
# - on-table b3
# - on-table b4
# - clear b1
# - clear b2
# - clear b3
# - (clear b4) is NOT true because b2 is on b4, so b4 is not clear.
# Goal:
# - on b1 b3
# - on b2 b1
# - on b3 b4
# - on-table b4
# PDDL3 Constraint:
# - sometime-before (on b2 b1) (on b1 b3)
#   This means: at some point during the plan, b1 must be on b3, and after that point, at some later time, b2 must be on b1. The constraint does NOT require that b1 remains on b3 until b2 is on b1; it only requires that there exists a time t1 where (on b1 b3) holds, and a time t2 > t1 where (on b2 b1) holds.
# Goal Analysis:
#   * b4 must be on-table (already satisfied initially).
#   * b3 must be on b4.
#   * b1 must be on b3.
#   * b2 must be on b1.
# Constraint Analysis:
#   * (on b1 b3) must occur sometime before (on b2 b1).
#   * Therefore, we must first achieve b1 on b3.
#   * Then, later, achieve b2 on b1.
#   * The final state must satisfy all goal facts; the constraint does not impose any requirement on the final state beyond the goal.
# Current Goal vs State:
#   - on b1 b3: FALSE
#   - on b2 b1: FALSE
#   - on b3 b4: FALSE
#   - on-table b4: TRUE
# Constraint vs Current State:
#   - on b1 b3: FALSE
#   - on b2 b1: FALSE
#   Constraint requires both to be achieved, with on b1 b3 before on b2 b1.
# Plan Strategy:
# 1. Move b3 onto b
