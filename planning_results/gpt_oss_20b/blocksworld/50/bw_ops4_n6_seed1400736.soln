analysisThe user provided a PDDL domain and problem. The domain is blocksworld with actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. The problem BW-rand-6 has objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b5
- on-table b2
- on b3 b1
- on b4 b6
- on b5 b4
- on-table b6
- clear b2
- clear b3
Goal:
- on b1 b6
- on b3 b2
- on b5 b3
- on b6 b4
Constraints:
- (sometime-before (on b3 b2) (on b1 b6))
So b3 on b2 must occur before b1 on b6. Also goal requires b5 on b3, b6 on b4, and b1 on b6.
We need to produce a plan satisfying all. Also constraints: The domain has :requirements :strips :constraints :negative-preconditions. So constraints are supported. The PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints. So plan must satisfy them. The constraints include only the sometime-before. Also there might be implicit constraints: all predicates with negative-preconditions must not be used incorrectly. Also domain has no invariants except those implied by constraints? There is no (clear ?x) (on-table ?x) (arm-empty) etc invariants. But blocksworld usually has constraints: on-table and on cannot hold simultaneously, clear and on cannot hold simultaneously, etc. But these are not explicitly encoded as constraints in the domain. However, the domain has negative-preconditions and effects that maintain consistency. So we rely on that.
We need to find a sequence of actions.
Let's analyze initial stack:
- b2 on-table, clear
- b6 on-table, clear
- b4 on b6, clear? Wait: on b4 b6, and clear b4? Actually clear b4 is not in init. So b4 is not clear. Since it's on b6, it's not clear. So clear b4 is false.
- b5 on b4, clear? b5 is on b4, and clear b5? In init, clear b5 is not present. So b5 is not clear.
- b1 on b5, clear? b1 is
