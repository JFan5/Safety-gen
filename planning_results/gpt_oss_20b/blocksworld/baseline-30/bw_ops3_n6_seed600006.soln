analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given blocksworld problem with constraints. Let's parse the problem.
Domain: blocksworld with actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack.
Objects: b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6.
Initial state:
- arm-empty
- on b1 b6
- on-table b2
- on-table b3
- on b4 b3
- on-table b5
- on b6 b4
- clear b1
- clear b2
- clear b5
Goal:
- on-table b1
- on b2 b4
- on b3 b1
- on b4 b6
- on b5 b3
- on b6 b5
Constraints: (sometime-before (on b2 b4) (on-table b1))
So we must ensure that at some point before the goal is achieved, the state (on b2 b4) occurs before (on-table b1). That is, the action that achieves on b2 b4 must happen before the action that achieves on-table b1. But the goal includes both, so we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying the constraint.
Let's analyze initial configuration:
- b1 on b6
- b6 on b4
- b4 on b3
- b3 on-table
- b2 on-table
- b5 on-table
Clear: b1, b2, b5.
Clear means no block on top of them.
Goal wants:
- b1 on-table
- b2 on b4
- b3 on b1
- b4 on b6
- b5 on b3
- b6 on b5
So final arrangement: b1 on-table, b3 on b1, b5 on b3, b6 on b5, b4 on b6, b2 on b4.
We need to achieve that.
We need to plan actions.
We have to consider constraints: (sometime-before (on b2 b4) (on-table b1)). So the action that achieves on b2 b4 must happen before the action that achieves on-table b1. That means we must stack b2 onto b4 before we put b1 on-table.
But the goal includes both, so we need to ensure that the action that puts b1 on-table occurs after the action
