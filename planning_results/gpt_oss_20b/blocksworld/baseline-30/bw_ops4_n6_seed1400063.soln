analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given blocksworld problem with constraints: "sometime-before (on b2 b5) (on b1 b4)". That means that at some point before the goal, the state (on b2 b5) must occur before (on b1 b4). But the goal requires both on b1 b4 and on b2 b5. So we need to ensure that at some point before achieving on b1 b4, we have achieved on b2 b5. So the plan must first achieve on b2 b5, then later on b1 b4. Also final state must satisfy all goal conditions: on b1 b4, on b2 b5, on b3 b2, on b5 b6, on b6 b1. Also initial state: b1, b2, b3 on table; b4 on b6; b5 on b3; b6 on table. Clear: b1, b2, b4, b5. So we need to build final stack: b6 on b1, b5 on b6, b2 on b5, b3 on b2, b1 on b4. Wait check: goal says on b1 b4, on b2 b5, on b3 b2, on b5 b6, on b6 b1. So final arrangement: b1 on b4, b2 on b5, b3 on b2, b5 on b6, b6 on b1. That forms a chain: b1 on b4, b2 on b5, b3 on b2, b5 on b6, b6 on b1. So the topmost block is b4? Actually b1 on b4 means b1 is on top of b4. b6 on b1 means b6 is on top of b1. b5 on b6 means b5 is on top of b6. b2 on b5 means b2 is on top of b5. b3 on b2 means b3 is on top of b2. So final stack: bottom: b4, then b1, then b6, then b5, then b2, then b3. Wait check: b6 on b1 means b6 is on top of b1. So order: bottom b4, then b1, then b6, then b5, then b
