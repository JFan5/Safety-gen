analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, c1. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (makes them distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l1, at c1 l5. at-ferry l0.
Goal: at c0 l2 and at c1 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l3)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l3 before c0 reaches l2, and ferry must be at l1 before c1 reaches l3. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that ferry starts at l0. It can sail to other locations. The ferry can carry cars. The ferry can board cars onto ferry at location where ferry is. The ferry can debark cars at location where ferry is.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3.
We need to ensure that at the time when c0 reaches l2, the ferry has already been at l3 at some earlier time. Similarly, at the time when c1 reaches l3, the ferry has already been at l1 earlier.
We can plan: ferry sails to l3, then board c0 at l1? Wait c0 is at l1 initially. We need to get c0 to l2. So we can sail to l1, board c0, sail to l2, debark. But we need to satisfy constraint: at-ferry l3 must happen before at c0 l2. So we need to have ferry at l3 before c0 reaches l2. So we need to sail to l3 before we bring c0 to l2. But we also need to bring c0 to l2. So we can do: sail to l3 first, then board c0 at l1? But ferry is at l3, not at l1. So we need to sail to l1 after l3. But the constraint says at-ferry l3 must happen before at c0 l2. So
