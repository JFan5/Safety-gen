analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2, l3. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry. at c0 l2, at c1 l2, at c2 l0. at-ferry l3.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l3, and ferry must be at l1 before c2 reaches l2. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that at start, ferry at l3. We need to get c1 to l3, c2 to l2, c0 stays at l2. c0 already at l2, so no action needed for c0.
We need to get c1 from l2 to l3. c2 from l0 to l2.
We need to ensure ferry at l0 before c1 reaches l3. So ferry must sail to l0 before we get c1 to l3. Also ferry must be at l1 before c2 reaches l2. So ferry must sail to l1 before we get c2 to l2.
We need to plan sequence.
Let's think: At start, ferry at l3. We can sail to l0 or l1 or l2 or l3? Actually at-ferry l3. We can sail to any location that is location and not-eq? The precondition for sail: (and (not-eq ?from ?to) (location ?from) (location ?to) (at-ferry ?from)). So we can sail from l3 to any other location. So we can sail to l0 or l1 or l2. But we need to satisfy constraints: ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l3. So we need to sail to l0 before we get c1 to l3.
