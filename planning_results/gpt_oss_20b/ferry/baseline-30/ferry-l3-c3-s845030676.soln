analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs: l0≠l1, l0≠l2, l1≠l2. empty-ferry true. at c0 l2, at c1 l1, at c2 l1. at-ferry l1.
Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l1, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l0)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l1, and before c2 reaches l2. So ferry must visit l0 before those events.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that at-ferry l0 must occur before at c0 l1 and at c2 l2. So the ferry must sail to l0 before those events happen.
We start at-ferry l1. So we need to sail to l0 first. Then we can board cars, etc.
Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l1, at c2 l2.
We have c1 at l1 initially, c2 at l1 initially. c0 at l2 initially. We need to move c0 to l1, c2 to l2.
We can board cars onto ferry at their location, then sail to destination, then debark.
We need to ensure ferry at l0 before c0 at l1 and c2 at l2. So we need to sail to l0 before moving c0 to l1 and c2 to l2.
We can plan: sail from l1 to l0. Then board c0 at l2? Wait c0 is at l2, not at l1. We need to get c0 to l1. So we need to bring c0 from l2 to l1. But ferry is at l0 after sailing. We can sail from l0 to l2 to pick up c0? But we need to bring c0 to
