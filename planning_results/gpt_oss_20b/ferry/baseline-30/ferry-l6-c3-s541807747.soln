analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all exist. Cars c0, c1, c2. At initial: c0 at l5, c1 at l3, c2 at l1. Ferry at l0. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l0.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l2) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l3)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l1 before c0 reaches l3 and before c1 reaches l2. And ferry must be at l3 before c2 reaches l2.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move cars to target locations. The ferry can carry one car at a time. The ferry starts at l0. It can sail to other locations, board cars, debark.
We need to get c0 to l3, c1 to l2, c2 to l2.
We need to ensure that at the time c0 reaches l3, ferry has already been at l1. Similarly for c1. And for c2, ferry must have been at l3 before c2 reaches l2.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
Let's design a plan.
We have 6 locations: l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5.
Cars: c0 at l5, c1 at l3, c2 at l1.
Goal: c0 at l3, c1 at l2, c2 at l2.
We need to move each car to target location.
We can plan:
1. Ferry sails from l0 to l1. (Now at l1)
2. Board c2 at l1 (since at-ferry l1, empty-ferry true, at c2 l1). After board, on c2, empty-ferry false.
3. Sail to l2. (Now at l2)
4.
