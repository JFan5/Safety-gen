analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Action sail: parameters ?from ?to. Preconditions: not-eq ?from ?to, location ?from, location ?to, at-ferry ?from. Effect: at-ferry ?to, not at-ferry ?from.
Action board: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, at ?car ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. Effect: on ?car, not at ?car ?loc, not empty-ferry.
Action debark: parameters ?car ?loc. Preconditions: car ?car, location ?loc, on ?car, at-ferry ?loc. Effect: at ?car ?loc, empty-ferry, not on ?car.
Problem objects: l0 l1 l2 l3, c0 c1 c2.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2, l3. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry. at c0 l0, at c1 l3, at c2 l1. at-ferry l3.
Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l0, at c2 l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c2 l0) (at-ferry l2)
So we need to ensure that at some point before each car reaches its goal location, the ferry is at a specific location.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that moves the ferry and cars accordingly.
Let's analyze.
Initial: ferry at l3. Car c0 at l0, c1 at l3, c2 at l1.
Goal: c0 at l1, c1 at l0, c2 at l0.
We need to move ferry to ferry cars to goal locations.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before c0 at l1, ferry at l2. So ferry must be at l2 before c0 reaches l1. Similarly, before
