analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, c1. not-eq pairs all distinct. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l4. at-ferry l5. So ferry starts at l5.
Goal: at c0 l5, at c1 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the ferry is at l1 when c0 reaches l5, and before c1 reaches l3, ferry must be at l0.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves goal while satisfying constraints.
We need to consider that ferry must travel to carry cars. The ferry can carry at most one car? The board action requires empty-ferry, so ferry empty initially. board requires at ?car ?loc, at-ferry ?loc, empty-ferry. So ferry can board a car at its location. After boarding, ferry has car on board, empty-ferry false. Then ferry can sail to another location, then debark.
Goal: c0 at l5, c1 at l3. Initially c0 at l0, c1 at l4. Ferry at l5.
We need to transport c0 from l0 to l5, and c1 from l4 to l3.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before c0 at l5, ferry at l1. So ferry must visit l1 before delivering c0 to l5. Similarly, before c1 at l3, ferry at l0.
We can plan: ferry starts at l5. It can sail to l1, board c0 at l0? Wait c0 at l0. Ferry at l5 cannot board c0 until it reaches l0. So maybe ferry goes to l0, board c0, sail to l5, deliver. But constraint requires ferry at l1 before c0 at l5. So we need to have ferry at l1 before delivering c0 to l5. So we can have ferry
