analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l4 defined. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (ensures distinctness). empty-ferry true. at c0 l4, at c1 l3, at c2 l3. at-ferry l2.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0)
So ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l2 and before c2 reaches l1. That means ferry must visit l0 before those events.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move cars to target locations. Initially c0 at l4, c1 at l3, c2 at l3. Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l3 (unchanged), c2 at l1.
We need to move c0 from l4 to l2, c2 from l3 to l1. The ferry starts at l2. We can sail to other locations, board cars, debark.
We must ensure ferry visits l0 before c0 reaches l2 and before c2 reaches l1. So ferry must sail to l0 at some point before those events.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
Let's design plan.
We have 5 locations: l0, l1, l2, l3, l4.
Initial: ferry at l2. Cars: c0 at l4, c1 at l3, c2 at l3.
Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l3 (unchanged), c2 at l1.
We need to move c0 to l2, c2 to l1.
We can board c0 at l4, sail to l0, debark at l0? Wait we need c0 at l2. So maybe we can board c0 at l4, sail to l2, debark at l2. But we also need ferry to visit l0 before
