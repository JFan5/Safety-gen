analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0, l1, l2, l3. car c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l2, at c1 l2, at c2 l0. at-ferry l1. So ferry starts at l1.
Goal: at c0 l0, at c1 l3, at c2 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l3)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l2)
So each car must reach its goal location before the ferry reaches a specific location. For c0: goal at l0 must be before ferry reaches l3. For c1: goal at l3 before ferry reaches l0. For c2: goal at l3 before ferry reaches l2.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider the ferry's movement and board/debark actions.
We have 4 locations: l0, l1, l2, l3. Ferry starts at l1. Cars: c0 at l2, c1 at l2, c2 at l0.
Goal: c0 at l0, c1 at l3, c2 at l3.
We need to move ferry to ferry cars to their destinations.
We need to satisfy constraints: at c0 l0 before ferry at l3. So ferry must reach l3 after c0 at l0. Similarly for c1 at l3 before ferry at l0. For c2 at l3 before ferry at l2.
We need to plan actions.
Let's think: ferry can sail between locations. It can board cars when at same location and ferry empty. Board action requires car at location, ferry at location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, ferry empty becomes false. Then ferry can sail to another location, then debark car.
We need to get each car to its goal.
Goal: c0 at l0, c1 at l3,
