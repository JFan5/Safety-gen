analysisWe need to produce a plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. Cars c0, c1. All not-eq pairs defined. empty-ferry true. at c0 l3, at c1 l3, at-ferry l3.
Goal: at c0 l3 (already true) and at c1 l0. So we need to move c1 from l3 to l0.
Constraint: sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1). Means that at some point before the goal is achieved, the ferry must be at l1. So we need to ensure that at some point before the goal, the ferry is at l1. That is a temporal constraint: at some point before the goal, the ferry must be at l1. So we need to include a step where at-ferry l1 holds before the goal is achieved. The goal is at c1 l0. So we need to have ferry at l1 before that.
We can plan: ferry starts at l3. We need to get c1 to l0. We can sail to l1, board c1, sail to l0, debark. But we need to satisfy constraint: at-ferry l1 sometime before goal. So we can have ferry at l1 before goal. That will happen if we sail to l1 before boarding c1? Wait, we need to board c1 at l3. But we can sail to l1 first, then board c1 at l3? But board requires at-ferry at location of car. So board requires at-ferry at the same location as car. So if we sail to l1, we cannot board c1 at l3 because ferry not at l3. So we need to board at l3. But we need ferry at l1 at some point before goal. We can sail to l1 after boarding? But board requires at-ferry at l3. So we can board at l3, then sail to l1, then debark at l0. But we need to ensure that at-ferry l1 holds at some point before goal. That will happen when ferry sails to l1. So plan: sail
