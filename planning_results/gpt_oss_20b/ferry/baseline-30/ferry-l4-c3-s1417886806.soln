analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l2. at-ferry l1. So ferry starts at l1.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l1, at c2 l1. So we need to move c0 to l3, and c1 and c2 to l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l2). Means at some point before the goal state, the ferry must be at l2. Actually "sometime-before" means that at some point before the goal, the ferry must be at l2. So we need to ensure that at some point before the final state, the ferry is at l2.
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l0). Means at some point before c2 is at l1, the ferry must be at l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that ends with the goal state.
We need to ensure that at some point before the goal, ferry at l2. Also at some point before c2 at l1, ferry at l0.
We also need to ensure that at the end, c0 at l3, c1 at l1, c2 at l1.
We need to consider the actions: board: requires car at location, ferry at location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, ferry remains at same location, empty-ferry becomes false. Debark: requires car on ferry, ferry at location, after debark car at location, ferry remains at location, empty-ferry becomes true.
Sail: requires ferry at from, location from and to exist, not-eq from to. After sail, ferry at to, not at from.
We need to plan.
We have initial: ferry at l1. Car c0 at l0, c1 at l1, c2 at l
