commentary# Plan Generation for PDDL Domain "ferry" with PDDL3 Constraints
## 1. Understand the Goal and Constraints
- Goal:
- AT c0 l2
- AT c1 l3
- AT c2 l0
- Constraints (PDDL3):
1. **sometime-before** (AT c0 l2) (AT-ferry l1)
- The ferry must be at location l1 *before* car c0 reaches l2.
2. **sometime-before** (AT c1 l3) (AT-ferry l0)
- The ferry must be at l0 *before* car c1 reaches l3.
3. **sometime-before** (AT c2 l0) (AT-ferry l1)
- The ferry must be at l1 *before* car c2 reaches l0.
## 2. Initial State
- AT c0 l0
- AT c1 l1
- AT c2 l3
- AT-ferry l3
- EMPTY-ferry
## 3. Plan Skeleton
We need to move:
- c0: l0 -> l2
- c1: l1 -> l3
- c2: l3 -> l0
Ferry starts at l3.
Constraints force the ferry to visit l1 before c0 reaches l2, l0 before c1 reaches l3, and l1 before c2 reaches l0.
Thus the ferry must visit l1 twice and l0 once, in that order relative to the car movements.
## 4. Determine Car Movement Order
To satisfy all constraints, a feasible order is:
1. Move c1 from l1 to l3.
- Requires ferry at l1 (to board c1) and later at l0 before c1 reaches l3.
2. Move c0 from l0 to l2.
- Requires ferry at l1 before c0 reaches l2.
3. Move c2 from l3 to l0.
- Requires ferry at l1 before c2 reaches l0.
This order respects:
- c1 goal (l3) after ferry visits l0.
- c0 goal (l2) after ferry visits l1.
- c2 goal (l0) after ferry visits l1.
## 5. Construct Detailed Plan
