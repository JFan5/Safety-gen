commentaryWe must produce plan for ferry-l5-c2. Domain: ferry with 5 locations l0..l4, 2 cars c0,c1. Initial: empty-ferry, at c0 l4, at c1 l4, at-ferry l1. Goal: at c0 l0, at c1 l3. Constraints: PDDL3: (sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l2)) and (sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)). So ferry must be at l2 before c0 reaches l0, and ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l3. Also must satisfy goal positions. No other constraints. So we need to plan sequence of sail, board, debark.
We need to move c0 from l4 to l0, c1 from l4 to l3. Starting ferry at l1, empty. Both cars at l4.
We can board one car at a time because empty-ferry requirement. So we need to sail to l4, board car, sail to target location, debark. For c0: target l0. For c1: target l3.
But constraints require ferry at l2 before c0 reaches l0. So we must sail to l2 at some point before final debark of c0 at l0. Also ferry at l0 before c1 reaches l3. So we must sail to l0 before final debark of c1 at l3.
Thus order: maybe move c0 first? Let's analyze.
Option 1: Move c0 to l0 first, then c1 to l3. But constraint: ferry must be at l2 before c0 at l0. So after moving c0 to l0, we must sail to l2 before moving c1 to l3. Also ferry must be at l0 before c1 at l3. So after moving c0, we sail to l2, then to l0, then ferry empty, then board c1, sail to l3, debark. That satisfies constraints: ferry at l2 before c0 l0 (yes, after debark at l0, we had sailed to l2). Ferry at l0 before c1 l3 (yes, we sailed to l0 before moving c1 to l3). So plan works.
We must ensure that during sailing, cars remain at their locations unless
