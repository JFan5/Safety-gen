commentary# Plan Generation for Ferry Domain (PDDL3 Constraints)
## Problem Overview
- **Locations (l0–l5)**: 6 total.
- **Cars (c0–c2)**: 3 total.
- **Initial State**
- Cars:
- c0 at l0
- c1 at l3
- c2 at l0
- Ferry: at l5, empty.
- **Goal State**
- c0 at l4
- c1 at l3 (unchanged)
- c2 at l1
## PDDL3 Constraints
1. **sometime-before (at c0 l4) (at-ferry l1)**
- The ferry must be at **l1** *before* **c0** arrives at **l4**.
- After this constraint is satisfied, it need not hold anymore.
2. **sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l2)**
- The ferry must be at **l2** *before* **c2** arrives at **l1**.
- Similarly, once satisfied, it need not hold thereafter.
## Strategy
- **c1** is already at its goal location (l3); it will remain untouched.
- **c0** and **c2** must be moved to l4 and l1 respectively.
- To satisfy the constraints, the ferry must visit **l1** *before* moving **c0** to **l4**, and **l2** *before* moving **c2** to **l1**.
- The ferry starts at **l5**; thus, a natural route is:
1. l5 → l1  (to satisfy constraint 1)
2. l1 → l0  (pick up c0)
3. l0 → l4  (deliver c0)
4. l4 → l2  (to satisfy constraint 2)
5. l2 → l0  (pick up c2)
6. l0 → l1  (deliver c2)
- No additional cars or locations interfere, so this route is feasible.
## Detailed Action Sequence
1. **sail l5 l1**          # Ferry reaches l1 (constraint 1 satisfied)
2. **sail l1 l0**          # Ferry
