commentary# Plan Generation for Ferry Domain (L4, C3)
# Initial State:
# Locations: l0, l1, l2, l3
# Cars: c0, c1, c2
# Car positions:
#   c0 at l3
#   c1 at l1
#   c2 at l2
# Ferry position: l3
# Ferry status: empty
# Goal:
#   c0 at l0
#   c1 at l0
#   c2 at l0
# Constraints (PDDL3):
#   1. c0 reaches l0 SOME TIME BEFORE the ferry reaches l1
#   2. c1 reaches l0 SOME TIME BEFORE the ferry reaches l2
#   3. c2 reaches l0 SOME TIME BEFORE the ferry reaches l1
# Strategy:
# - Move the ferry to l1 first (to satisfy constraints 1 & 3).
# - Debark c1 at l1 (it is already there) -> not needed.
# - Board c0 at l3? Ferry is at l1, so first sail to l3.
# - Board c0 at l3.
# - Sail to l0.
# - Debark c0 at l0. (Constraint 1 satisfied: l0 reached before ferry l1)
# - Sail to l1 (still before ferry l2 for c1).
# - Debark c1 at l1. (Now ferry at l1, c1 at l1)
# - Sail to l2 (now after ferry l1, before ferry l1 for c2 constraint).
# - Board c2 at l2.
# - Sail to l1 (now after ferry l2, before ferry l1 for c2).
# - Sail to l0.
# - Debark c1 at l0. (Constraint 2 satisfied: l0 before ferry l2)
# - Debark c2 at l0. (Constraint 3 satisfied: l0 before ferry l1)
# All cars at l0, ferry at l0. Constraints satisfied.
# Plan Steps:
# 1. sail l1 l3
# 2. board c0 l3
# 3. sail l3 l0
# 4. debark c0 l0
# 5. sail l0 l1
# 6. sail l1 l2
# 7. board
