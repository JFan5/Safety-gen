commentary# The user has provided a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem.
# The domain is "ferry" with 4 locations (l0, l1, l2, l3) and 2 cars (c0, c1).
# The problem "ferry-l4-c2" has:
#   - Initial state:
#       * car c0 at location l3
#       * car c1 at location l0
#       * ferry at location l3
#       * ferry empty
#   - Goal:
#       * car c0 at location l1
#       * car c1 at location l0 (already there)
#   - PDDL3 constraint:
#       * (sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0))
# This means: at some point before c0 reaches l1, the ferry must be at l0.
# So the ferry must travel to l0 before the goal (c0 l1) is achieved.
#
# The user has requested:
#   - Output only the plan steps, one per line.
#   - Each line format: (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
#   - No explanations, comments, headers.
#   - Must not contain natural language sentences.
#   - Must satisfy PDDL3 constraints.
#
# Therefore, we must produce a valid plan that:
#   1. Moves the ferry to l0 before c0 reaches l1.
#   2. Eventually debarks c0 at l1.
#   3. Keeps c1 at l0 (it's already there, so no action needed).
#
# Let's design the plan:
# Initial: ferry at l3, c0 at l3, c1 at l0, ferry empty.
#
# Step 1: sail from l3 to l2.  (sail l3 l2)
# Step 2: sail from l2 to l0.  (sail l2 l0)
# Now ferry at l0, c0 still at l3, c1 at l0, ferry not empty.
#
# We need to get c0 to l1. The ferry can carry only one car.
# We could sail to l3, board c0, sail to l1, debark c0.
#
# Step 3: sail from l0 to l1?  That would take ferry to l1
