analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, car c1. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (so all distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l4. at-ferry l5. So ferry starts at l5.
Goal: at c0 l5, at c1 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
So we need to ensure that at some point before c0 reaches l5, ferry is at l1. And before c1 reaches l3, ferry is at l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move ferry from l5 to somewhere to pick up c0 at l0, then bring to l5? Wait goal: c0 at l5. So we need to transport c0 from l0 to l5. c1 from l4 to l3.
We need to ensure that at some point before c0 at l5, ferry at l1. So ferry must visit l1 before delivering c0 to l5. Similarly, before c1 at l3, ferry at l0.
We can plan: ferry starts at l5. It can sail to l0, board c0, sail to l5, debark. But we need to visit l1 before delivering c0 to l5. So we can have ferry sail to l1, then to l0, board c0, then sail to l5. That satisfies constraint: at some point before at c0 l5, ferry at l1. Yes.
Similarly, before c1 at l3, ferry at l0. So we need ferry to be at l0 before delivering c1 to l3. We can have ferry sail to l0, board c1, sail to l3. But we need to ensure that ferry at l0 before delivering c1 to l3. So we can have ferry at l0 after delivering c0? Wait we need to deliver c1 to l3. We can have ferry at l0
