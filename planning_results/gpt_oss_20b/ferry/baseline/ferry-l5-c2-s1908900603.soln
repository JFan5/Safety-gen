analysisWe need to produce a plan that satisfies goal: at c0 l0 and at c1 l3. Starting state: c0 and c1 at l4. Ferry at l1. Empty ferry. We need to move ferry to appropriate locations to transport cars. Constraints:
1. sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l2)
2. sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l0)
So at some point before c0 reaches l0, ferry must be at l2. Similarly before c1 reaches l3, ferry must be at l0.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves goal while satisfying constraints.
We need to consider actions: sail, board, debark. The ferry can carry one car at a time (since empty-ferry indicates no car on board). board requires empty-ferry and at-ferry at location, car at that location. After board, ferry has car on board, empty-ferry false. Debark requires on car and at-ferry at location.
We need to move ferry from l1 to l2 to satisfy first constraint. Then ferry must transport c0 to l0. Then ferry must go to l0 to satisfy second constraint before c1 to l3. Then ferry must transport c1 to l3.
We need to ensure ferry can sail to l2, then to l0, etc.
Let's design plan:
Initial: ferry at l1. Car c0 at l4, c1 at l4.
Goal: c0 at l0, c1 at l3.
We need to move ferry to l2 first. So sail l1 to l2. Then board c0 at l4? Wait c0 at l4, ferry at l2. Can't board because ferry not at l4. So we need ferry to go to l4 to board c0. But constraint requires ferry at l2 before c0 at l0. So we can sail to l2, then to l4, board c0, sail to l0, debark. That satisfies constraint: at-ferry l2 before at c0 l0. Good.
Similarly, before c1 at l3, ferry must be at l0. So after delivering c0 to l0, ferry at l0. Then ferry can go to l4 to board c1, sail to l3, debark. That satisfies second constraint: at-ferry l0 before at c1
