analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain with constraints. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs all distinct. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l0. at-ferry l3. So ferry starts at l3.
Goal: at c0 l2, at c1 l0, at c2 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The action (at c0 l2) must occur before the ferry reaches l1. Similarly, (at c1 l0) before ferry reaches l2. And (at c2 l3) before ferry reaches l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that at-ferry l1 must happen after at c0 l2. So ferry must reach l1 after c0 is at l2. Similarly, ferry must reach l2 after c1 at l0. And ferry must reach l1 after c2 at l3.
We need to plan sequence of actions: sail, board, debark.
We need to move cars to target locations.
Goal: c0 at l2, c1 at l0, c2 at l3.
Initial: c0 at l0, c1 at l1, c2 at l0. Ferry at l3.
We need to move c0 to l2, c1 to l0, c2 to l3.
We can board cars onto ferry at their current location, then sail to destination, then debark.
We need to satisfy constraints: at c0 l2 before ferry at l1. So ferry must reach l1 after c0 at l2. So we can have ferry sail to l1 after delivering c0 to l2. Similarly, at c1 l0 before ferry at l2. So ferry must reach l2 after delivering c1 to l0. Also at c
