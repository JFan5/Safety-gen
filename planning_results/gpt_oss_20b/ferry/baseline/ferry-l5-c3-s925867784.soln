analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l4 defined. cars c0, c1, c2 at l0, l1, l2 respectively. Ferry at l2. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l2. at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l2. Also not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (ensures distinctness). The goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l3. So we need to move cars to those locations.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l3) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c1 l2) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c2 l3) (at-ferry l0)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l1 before c0 reaches l3; ferry must be at l0 before c1 reaches l2; ferry must be at l0 before c2 reaches l3. So we need to schedule ferry visits accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that board action requires at-ferry at location, empty-ferry, car at location, etc. Debark requires on car, at-ferry at location.
Goal: c0 at l3, c1 at l2, c2 at l3.
We start with ferry at l2. We can sail to other locations.
We need to get c0 to l3. Initially at l0. So we need to board c0 at l0, ferry to l3, debark at l3. But constraint: at c0 l3 must happen before at-ferry l1. So ferry must be at l1 before c0 reaches l3. That means we need to have ferry at l1 before we bring c0 to l3. But we can bring c0 to l3 by ferry traveling to l3. But we need to ensure that at-ferry l1 occurs before at c0 l3. So we need to have ferry at l1 before we bring c0 to l3. So we can first sail to l1, then board c0
