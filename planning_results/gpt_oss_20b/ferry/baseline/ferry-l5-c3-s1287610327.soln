analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry domain with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l4 all exist. cars c0, c1, c2. at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l4. at-ferry l0. empty-ferry true. So ferry starts at l0, empty.
Goal: at c0 l3, at c1 l2, at c2 l0. So we need to move car c2 from l4 to l0. Also need to satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at c2 l0) (at-ferry l1). Means at some point before c2 reaches l0, ferry must be at l1. So we need to ensure that at some point before final state, ferry is at l1. That is a temporal constraint: at some point before the goal, at-ferry l1 must hold. So we need to plan such that ferry visits l1 before c2 reaches l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that ferry can sail between locations, board cars onto ferry, debark them. The ferry can carry at most one car? The predicates: empty-ferry indicates ferry empty. board action requires empty-ferry. So ferry can carry one car at a time. After board, empty-ferry false. After debark, empty-ferry true again.
Goal: c2 at l0. So we need to transport c2 from l4 to l0. We can sail ferry from l0 to l1, then to l2, etc. But we need to ensure ferry visits l1 before c2 reaches l0. So we can sail ferry to l1 before moving c2 to l0.
We also need to keep c0 at l3 and c1 at l2 unchanged. So we don't need to move them.
We need to produce a plan that moves c2 from l4 to l0. The ferry starts at l0. So we can sail to l1, then to l2, etc. But we need to board c2 at l4, then sail to l0, debark. But we need to ensure ferry visits l1 before c2 reaches l0. So we can sail
