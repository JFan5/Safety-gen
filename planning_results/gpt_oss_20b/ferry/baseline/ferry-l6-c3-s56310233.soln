analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem with constraints: at some point before (at c0 l4) must be (at-ferry l0). And before (at c1 l1) must be (at-ferry l2). So we need to schedule ferry movements such that at some point before c0 reaches l4, ferry is at l0. Similarly before c1 reaches l1, ferry at l2.
We have initial positions: c0 at l2, c1 at l0, c2 at l3. Ferry at l5. Empty ferry.
Goal: c0 at l4, c1 at l1, c2 at l3 (c2 already at l3). So we need to move c0 to l4, c1 to l1. Ferry must transport them.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before c0 at l4, ferry at l0. So we need to have ferry at l0 before delivering c0 to l4. Similarly, before c1 at l1, ferry at l2.
We can plan: ferry moves from l5 to l0, then board c1 at l0, then sail to l1, debark c1. Then ferry moves to l2, board c0 at l2, sail to l4, debark c0. Meanwhile c2 stays at l3.
We must ensure ferry at l0 before c1 at l1? Wait constraint is for c1 at l1: (sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)). So ferry must be at l2 before c1 at l1. But we plan to deliver c1 at l1 after ferry at l1? Actually we deliver c1 at l1 after ferry at l1. But constraint requires ferry at l2 before c1 at l1. So we need to have ferry at l2 before delivering c1 to l1. So we need to have ferry at l2 before that. So we can have ferry go to l2 before delivering c1. But we also need ferry at l0 before c0 at l4. So we need to schedule accordingly.
Let's design plan:
1. sail l5 l0 (ferry at l0)
2. board c1 at l0
3. sail l0 l1 (ferry at l1)
4. debark c1 at l1
5. sail l1 l
