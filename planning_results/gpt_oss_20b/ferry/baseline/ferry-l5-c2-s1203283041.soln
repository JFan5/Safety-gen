analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem with constraints: at c0 l0 and at c1 l1. Also constraints: sometime-before (at c0 l0) (at-ferry l1) and sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l3). Means that at some point before the ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l0. Similarly, before ferry reaches l3, c1 must be at l1. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We have objects: locations l0-l4, cars c0, c1. Initially: at c0 l4, at c1 l2, ferry at l0, empty-ferry. We need to get c0 to l0, c1 to l1. We can board cars onto ferry, sail, debark.
We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l0. So we need to get c0 to l0 before ferry reaches l1. Similarly, before ferry reaches l3, c1 must be at l1.
We can plan: ferry starts at l0. We need to get c0 to l0. But c0 is at l4 initially. So we need to bring ferry to l4, board c0, sail to l0, debark. That would satisfy c0 at l0 before ferry reaches l1? Wait, ferry will sail from l0 to l4? Actually ferry at l0 initially. To board c0 at l4, ferry must sail to l4. But constraint: at some point before ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l0. So we need to get c0 to l0 before ferry reaches l1. So we can sail to l4, board c0, sail to l0, debark. Then ferry at l0 again. Then we need to get c1 to l1. c1 is at l2 initially. We can sail to l2, board c1, sail to l1, debark. But we must ensure that before ferry reaches l3, c1 must be at l1. So we need to get c1 to l1 before ferry reaches l3. So we can sail to l2, board c1, sail to l1, debark. Then ferry at l1. Then we need to get ferry to l3? Actually we need to satisfy constraint: sometime-before
