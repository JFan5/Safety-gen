analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all have predicate location. cars c0, c1. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l1, at c1 l5. at-ferry l0.
Goal: at c0 l2 and at c1 l3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l3)
- sometime-before (at c1 l3) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l3 before c0 reaches l2, and ferry must be at l1 before c1 reaches l3. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that board action requires at-ferry at location, empty-ferry, car at location. board moves car onto ferry, sets on car, empties ferry.
Debark action requires on car, at-ferry at location, and location. It moves car to location, empties ferry.
Sail action moves ferry from from to to, requires at-ferry at from, location at both, not-eq from to.
We need to plan to get c0 to l2 and c1 to l3.
We have initial positions: c0 at l1, c1 at l5. Ferry at l0.
We need to get ferry to l3 before c0 at l2. So ferry must sail to l3 before c0 reaches l2. Similarly ferry must sail to l1 before c1 reaches l3.
We can plan: ferry sails to l3, board c0 at l1? Wait board requires at-ferry at location. So ferry must be at l1 to board c0. But we need ferry at l3 before c0 at l2. So we can board c0 at l1, ferry sails to l3, then debark at l2? Wait we need c0 at l2. So we need to get c0 to l2. So we can board c0 at l1, ferry sails to l2, debark at l2. But constraint requires ferry at l3 before c0 at l
