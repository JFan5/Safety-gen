analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem with constraints: at some point before (at c0 l2) must be (at-ferry l0). Similarly before (at c2 l1) must be (at-ferry l0). So ferry must be at l0 before those events. We need to move cars to goal positions: c0 to l2, c1 stays at l3, c2 to l1. Initially ferry at l2. Cars: c0 at l4, c1 at l3, c2 at l3. We need to get c0 to l2, c2 to l1. Ferry can sail between locations. We need to satisfy constraints: at some point before (at c0 l2) the ferry must be at l0. Similarly before (at c2 l1). So we need to sail to l0 before moving those cars.
We need to plan sequence of actions: board, sail, debark, etc.
We must ensure that at the time we move c0 to l2, ferry is at l0. Similarly for c2 to l1.
We can plan: ferry starts at l2. We can sail to l0 first. Then board c0 at l4? Wait c0 at l4 initially. Ferry at l0 after sailing. But to board c0, ferry must be at same location as car. So we need to sail to l4 to board c0. But constraint requires ferry at l0 before moving c0 to l2. So we need to have ferry at l0 before we move c0 to l2. But we can board c0 at l4, then sail to l2, debark at l2. But ferry must be at l0 before that. So we need to sail to l0 first, then later sail to l4 to board c0. But constraint says "sometime-before (at c0 l2) (at-ferry l0)". That means at some point before the goal state (c0 at l2) the ferry must be at l0. It doesn't require that ferry is at l0 at the same time as c0 at l2, just before that event. So we can sail to l0 early, then later board c0 at l4, sail to l2, debark. That satisfies constraint.
Similarly for c2 to l1: we need ferry at l0 before that. So we can
