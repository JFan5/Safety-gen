analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all exist. cars c0, c1, c2 at l2, l3, l0 respectively. Ferry at l2. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l2. at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l0. Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l0, at c2 l0. So we need to move c0 to l1, c1 to l0, c2 stays at l0. Ferry must transport cars.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: at some point before the ferry reaches l0, c0 must be at l1. Similarly, before ferry reaches l1, c1 must be at l0. So we need to schedule ferry visits accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
Let's think: initial ferry at l2. We need to get c0 to l1. c0 starts at l2. So we can board c0 at l2, sail to l1, debark at l1. That satisfies first constraint: at some point before ferry reaches l0, c0 at l1. After that, ferry can go to l0 to bring c1 to l0. But we also need to bring c1 to l0. c1 starts at l3. So we need to bring ferry to l3, board c1, sail to l0, debark. That satisfies second constraint: before ferry reaches l1, c1 at l0. Wait constraint: sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1). So before ferry reaches l1, c1 must be at l0. So we need to bring c1 to l0 before ferry reaches l1. So we need to bring ferry to l0 before it goes to l1. So order: ferry goes to l0 first, bring c1 to l0, then go to l1 to bring c0. But we also need to bring c0 to l1.
