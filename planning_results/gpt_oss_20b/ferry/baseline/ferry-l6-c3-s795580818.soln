analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all exist. cars c0, c1, c2 at l2, l3, l0 respectively. ferry at l2. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l2. at c0 l2, at c1 l3, at c2 l0. Goal: at c0 l1, at c1 l0, at c2 l0. So we need to move c0 to l1, c1 to l0, c2 stays at l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l1) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Meaning: at some point before the ferry reaches l0, c0 must be at l1. Similarly, before ferry reaches l1, c1 must be at l0. So we need to schedule ferry visits accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
Let's think: initial ferry at l2. We need to get c0 to l1. c0 currently at l2. So we need to board c0 at l2, sail to l1, debark at l1. That satisfies first constraint: at some point before ferry reaches l0, c0 at l1. So we can sail to l1, then later ferry goes to l0. But we also need to get c1 to l0. c1 currently at l3. We need to get c1 to l0. We can board c1 at l3, sail to l0, debark at l0. That satisfies second constraint: at some point before ferry reaches l1, c1 at l0. But we need to ensure ferry reaches l1 before reaching l0? Wait constraint: sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1). Means at some point before the ferry reaches l1, c1 must be at l0. So we need to have c1 at l0 before ferry reaches l1. So we need to get c1 to l0 before ferry goes to l1. So we need to schedule: ferry goes to l0 first, then
