analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, c1. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (makes them distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l4, at c1 l3. at-ferry l4. So ferry starts at l4.
Goal: at c0 l5, at c1 l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l5, and ferry must be at l1 before c1 reaches l0. So ferry must visit l0 before c0 gets to l5, and visit l1 before c1 gets to l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move ferry from l4 to l5 to bring c0 to l5, and ferry to l0 to bring c0 to l5? Wait, constraint: at c0 l5 must happen before at-ferry l0. That means ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l5. So ferry must go to l0 before c0 gets to l5. But c0 starts at l4. So we need to bring c0 to l5. But ferry must be at l0 before that. So ferry must travel to l0 first, then later to l5 to bring c0. But c0 starts at l4. So we need to board c0 onto ferry at l4, then ferry travels to l5, debark c0 at l5. But we also need ferry to be at l0 before that. So we need to travel to l0 before ferry goes to l5. But ferry starts at l4. So we can sail to l0 first, then sail to l5. But we need to bring c0 onto ferry at l4. But ferry is at l4 initially. So we can board c0 at l4, then sail to l0, then sail to l5, then debark c0 at l5. But we need to ensure ferry is
