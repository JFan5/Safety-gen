analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: location l0..l5 all true. car c0, c1. not-eq constraints between all pairs of locations (makes them distinct). empty-ferry true. at c0 l4, at c1 l3. at-ferry l4. So ferry starts at l4.
Goal: at c0 l5 and at c1 l0.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l5) (at-ferry l0)
- sometime-before (at c1 l0) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: The ferry must be at l0 before c0 reaches l5, and ferry must be at l1 before c1 reaches l0. So ferry must visit l0 before c0 at l5, and l1 before c1 at l0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to consider that board action requires at-car at location, at-ferry at location, empty-ferry. After board, car is on ferry, at location removed, ferry empty-ferry false. Debark action requires on car, at-ferry at location, then car at location, empty-ferry true.
Sail action moves ferry from from to to, requires at-ferry at-from, location at-from and to, not-eq from to.
We need to plan sequence.
Goal: c0 at l5, c1 at l0.
We start with c0 at l4, c1 at l3, ferry at l4.
We need to get c0 to l5, c1 to l0.
We need to satisfy constraints: ferry must be at l0 before c0 at l5, and ferry at l1 before c1 at l0.
Thus ferry must visit l0 before delivering c0 to l5, and l1 before delivering c1 to l0.
We can plan: ferry starts at l4. It can sail to l0? But need to board c0 at l4, then sail to l5? Wait, we need to deliver c0 to l5. But constraint says ferry must be at l0 before c0 at l5. That means ferry must visit l0 before delivering
