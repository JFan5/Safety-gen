analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the ferry domain. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0..l5 all exist. cars c0, c1, c2. at c0 l0, at c1 l3, at c2 l0. at-ferry l5. empty-ferry true. at-ferry l5.
Goal: at c0 l4, at c1 l3, at c2 l1.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c0 l4) (at-ferry l1)
- sometime-before (at c2 l1) (at-ferry l2)
Interpretation: at some point before the ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l4. Similarly, before ferry reaches l2, c2 must be at l1.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.
We need to move cars to target locations. The ferry starts at l5. It can sail to other locations. The ferry can board cars onto it at a location where the car is present and ferry is present, and empty-ferry is true. Then debark at another location.
Goal: c0 at l4, c1 at l3 (already at l3), c2 at l1.
We need to ensure constraints: at some point before ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l4. That means we must deliver c0 to l4 before ferry reaches l1. Similarly, before ferry reaches l2, c2 must be at l1.
We can plan: ferry starts at l5. It can sail to l4, board c0 at l4? Wait c0 is at l0 initially. So we need to bring c0 to l4. We can sail to l0, board c0, sail to l4, debark. But constraint: at some point before ferry reaches l1, c0 must be at l4. So we need to deliver c0 to l4 before ferry reaches l1. That is fine.
Similarly, c2 at l0 initially. We need to bring c2 to l1 before ferry reaches l2. So we need to deliver c2 to l1 before ferry reaches l2.
We also need to keep c1 at l3 (already there
