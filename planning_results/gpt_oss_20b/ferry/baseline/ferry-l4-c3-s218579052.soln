analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: ferry with actions: sail, board, debark.
Predicates: not-eq, car, location, at-ferry, at, empty-ferry, on.
Initial state: locations l0, l1, l2, l3 exist. cars c0, c1, c2. not-eq pairs for all distinct pairs. empty-ferry true. at c0 l0, at c1 l0, at c2 l3. at-ferry l0.
Goal: at c0 l0, at c1 l1, at c2 l2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)
- sometime-before (at c2 l2) (at-ferry l1)
Interpretation: at some point before the ferry reaches l2, car c1 must be at l1. Similarly, before ferry reaches l1, car c2 must be at l2. Wait: The constraint is "sometime-before (at c1 l1) (at-ferry l2)". Means that at some point before the ferry reaches l2, the car c1 must be at l1. So the ferry must reach l2 after c1 is at l1. Similarly, at some point before the ferry reaches l1, car c2 must be at l2. So we need to schedule actions accordingly.
Goal: c0 at l0 (already), c1 at l1, c2 at l2.
We need to move c1 from l0 to l1, and c2 from l3 to l2. The ferry starts at l0. We can sail to other locations, board cars, etc.
We need to satisfy constraints: before ferry reaches l2, c1 must be at l1. So we need to get c1 to l1 before ferry reaches l2. Similarly, before ferry reaches l1, c2 must be at l2. So we need to get c2 to l2 before ferry reaches l1.
We can plan: ferry at l0 initially. c0 at l0, c1 at l0, c2 at l3. We need to get c1 to l1, c2 to l2. We can board c1 onto ferry at l0, sail to l1, debark c1 at l1. That satisfies constraint
