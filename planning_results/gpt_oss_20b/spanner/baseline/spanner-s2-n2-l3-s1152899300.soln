analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Problem objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, nut1, nut2, location1, location2, location3, shed, gate.
Initial state:
- at bob shed
- at spanner1 location3
- useable spanner1
- at spanner2 location1
- useable spanner2
- loose nut1
- at nut1 gate
- loose nut2
- at nut2 gate
- link shed location1
- link location3 gate
- link location1 location2
- link location2 location3
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). So each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1, location2, location3, gate. He must pick up spanner(s) to tighten nuts. Spanner must be useable. After using spanner, useable becomes false. So spanner cannot be reused. But we have two spanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location1. Both useable initially. So Bob can use one spanner to tighten nut1, then use the other to tighten nut2. But spanner1 is at location3, spanner2 at location1. Bob starts at shed. He can walk
