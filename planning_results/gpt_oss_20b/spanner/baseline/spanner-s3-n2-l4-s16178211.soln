analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable. Objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, nut1, nut2, location1-4, shed, gate.
Predicates: at ?m ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, link ?l1 ?l2, tightened ?n, loose ?n.
Actions:
walk: from start to end if link exists. Effect: bob moves.
pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, bob at l. After pickup, spanner not at l, bob carrying s.
tighten_nut: at location l, bob at l, nut at l, bob carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: loose n removed, useable s removed, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider spanner positions: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1. All useable.
Bob starts at shed. Links: shed - location1, location4 - gate, location1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob can walk along links.
Nut1 at gate, loose. Nut2 at gate, loose.
Goal: tighten both nuts. Must tighten nut1 before nut2.
We need to pick a spanner to tighten each nut. Spanners are useable. After use, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 3 spanners. We need to use at least two spanners to tighten both nuts. We can use spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1. Bob must pick up spanner, walk to nut location, tighten nut, then maybe pick another
