analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner domain with types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 3 locations: location1, location2, location3, plus shed and gate. Links: shed-location1, location3-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> gate. Also location3-gate link. So to get to nuts at gate, Bob must walk from shed to location1 to location2 to location3 to gate. He can walk along links.
Spanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location2. Both useable.
Nuts: nut1 at gate, loose; nut2 at gate, loose.
Goal: tighten both nuts. Must tighten nut1 before nut2.
We need to pick spanner to tighten nuts. Use spanner1 or spanner2. Useable spanner must be used to tighten. After use, useable becomes false. So we need to use both spanners? Actually we can use spanner1 to tighten nut1, then spanner2 to tighten nut2. But spanner1 is at location3, spanner2 at location2. Bob must pick up spanner at
