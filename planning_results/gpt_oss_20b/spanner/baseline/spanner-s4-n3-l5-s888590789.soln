analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner domain with actions: walk, pickup_spanner, tighten_nut.
Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Objects: bob (man), spanner1-4, nut1-3, location1-5, shed, gate.
Initial state: bob at shed. Spanners at various locations: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location5, spanner3 at location4, spanner4 at location3. All spanners useable. Nuts loose at gate. Links: shed-location1, location5-gate, location1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.
Goal: all nuts tightened.
Constraints: (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)) meaning nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed after leaving. So Bob must leave shed and never return.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must walk to somewhere else, pick up spanner, tighten nuts, etc. He cannot return to shed. So he must finish at some other location, not shed.
Goal: tighten all nuts. We need to use spanners to tighten nuts. Each spanner can be used once? Actually useable predicate indicates spanner is usable. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 4 spanners. Nuts: 3 nuts. So we can use 3 spanners to tighten nuts. We need to ensure that spanner used for each nut is at same location as nut. Nuts are at gate. So spanners must be at gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location5, spanner3 at location4, spanner4 at location3. We need to walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are not at gate. We can walk to gate, but spanners are not at gate. We can pick up spanner at its location, carry it to gate, then tighten nut. But spanner must be at same location as nut to tighten.
