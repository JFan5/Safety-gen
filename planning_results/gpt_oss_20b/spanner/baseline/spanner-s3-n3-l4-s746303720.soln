analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must avoid returning to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Let's analyze initial state:
- bob at shed.
- spanner1 at location4, useable spanner1.
- spanner2 at location3, useable spanner2.
- spanner3 at location2, useable spanner3.
- loose nut1 at gate.
- loose nut2 at gate.
- loose nut3 at gate.
- links: shed- location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4.
So the graph: shed connected to location1. location1 to location2. location2 to location3. location3 to location4. location4 to gate. So path from shed to gate: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. So bob can walk along that path.
Goal: tighten all nuts. He needs spanner at location of nut to tighten. Spanners are at location4, location3, location2. Nuts are at gate. So bob must walk to gate, pick up a
