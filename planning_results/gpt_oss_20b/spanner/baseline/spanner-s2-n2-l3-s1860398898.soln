analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable. Objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, nut1, nut2, location1, location2, location3, shed, gate.
Predicates: at ?m ?l (man or spanner at location), carrying ?m ?s (man carrying spanner), useable ?s, link ?l1 ?l2, tightened ?n, loose ?n.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man at l, spanner at l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man at l, nut at l, carrying spanner, useable spanner, loose nut. Effect: not loose, not useable, tightened.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have initial positions: bob at shed. spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location3. nut1 at gate, nut2 at gate. All nuts loose. Useable spanner1 and spanner2. Links: shed-location1, location3-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> gate. So Bob must walk from shed to location1 to location2 to location3 to gate. He can pick up spanner at location2 or location3. He must tighten nut1 first, then nut2. He must not return to shed. So plan: walk to location1, then location2, pick up spanner1, walk to location3, pick up spanner2? Actually spanner2 at location3. But spanner1 at location2. He can use sp
