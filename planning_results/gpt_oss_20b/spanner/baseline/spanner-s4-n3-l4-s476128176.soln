analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed after leaving. So Bob must not go back to shed after leaving.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 4 locations: location1, location2, location3, location4. Links: shed -> location1, location4 -> gate, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Also location4 -> gate link.
Spanners: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location4, spanner4 at location2. All useable.
Nuts: nut1, nut2, nut3 all loose at gate.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Must use spanner to tighten each nut. Useable spanner must be used to tighten a nut; after use, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 4 spanners, enough to tighten 3 nuts.
We need to plan: Bob starts at shed. He cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must go to location1, then location2, location3, location4, gate. He can pick
