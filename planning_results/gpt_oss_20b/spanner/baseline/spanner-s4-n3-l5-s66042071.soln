analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed at most once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must leave shed and cannot return. So we must not have any action that brings Bob back to shed. So we must avoid walking back to shed.
We need to tighten all nuts. They are all at gate initially. So Bob must go to gate, pick up spanner, tighten nuts. But spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location2, spanner4 at location4. All spanners are useable initially. Bob can pick up any spanner at its location. He must use a spanner to tighten nuts. After tightening a nut, the spanner becomes not useable. So each spanner can be used only once. So we need to use three spanners to tighten three nuts. We have four spanners, so fine.
We need to satisfy constraint: nut2 tightened before nut3. So we must tighten nut2 first, then nut3. Order of nut1 relative to others not constrained.
We need to ensure Bob never returns to shed. So we must not
