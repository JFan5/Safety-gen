analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Problem: objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, nut1, nut2, location1-4, shed, gate.
Initial: bob at shed. spanner1 at location3, useable spanner1. spanner2 at location1, useable spanner2. spanner3 at location1, useable spanner3. loose nut1 at gate. loose nut2 at gate. links: shed-location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4.
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints: (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)) meaning nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). So bob can be at shed at most once. Since bob starts at shed, he cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1, location2, location3, location4, gate. He must pick up spanner(s) and tighten nuts. He cannot return to shed. So he must go from shed to location1, then to location2, location3, location4, gate. He can pick up spanner at location1 or location3. Spanner1 at location3, spanner2 and spanner3 at location1. He can pick up spanner2 or spanner3 at location1. He can use spanner to tighten nuts at gate. But spanner must be at
