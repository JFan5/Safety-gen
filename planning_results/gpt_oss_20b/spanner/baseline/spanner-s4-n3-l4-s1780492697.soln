analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, carrying s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1, location2, location3, location4, gate? Wait, link: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. But spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1, spanner4 at location4. Nuts at gate. So Bob must go to gate to tighten nuts. But he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he can start at shed, walk to location1, etc. He can walk to gate via location4. But he must pick up spanner at each location to tighten nuts. But spanner must be useable. Useable spanner1,2,3,4. Useable spanner becomes not useable after tightening a nut. So each spanner can be used only once. But we have 4 spanners, 3 nuts. So we can use any spanner to tighten each nut. But we must satisfy constraint
