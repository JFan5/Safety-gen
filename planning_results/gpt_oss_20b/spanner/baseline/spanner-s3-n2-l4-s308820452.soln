analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying m s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location where spanner1, spanner2, spanner3 are located. He can pick up spanner, use to tighten nuts at gate. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must go to gate, pick up a spanner, tighten nut1, then later tighten nut2. But must not return to shed. So Bob must leave shed and never return.
We need to ensure that at most once at shed. Starting at shed counts as one. So we cannot have any action that brings Bob back to shed. So we must avoid walking back to shed.
We need to plan path: Bob at shed. Links: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> gate. So path from shed to gate: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. So Bob can walk along that path.
Spanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location2. All useable.
Nuts: nut1 at gate, nut2
