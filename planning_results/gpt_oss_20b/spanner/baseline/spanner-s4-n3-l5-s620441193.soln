analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, carrying s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1 to pick up spanner1 or spanner3? Spanner1 at location1, spanner3 at location1, spanner4 at location3, spanner2 at location5. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must go to gate to tighten nuts. But he must be at location where spanner is. He can walk from shed to location1 via link. Then pick up spanner1 or spanner3. Then walk to gate via link chain: location1->location2->location3->location4->location5->gate? Wait link: location5 gate. So path: location1->location2->location3->location4->location5->gate. So Bob must walk through these locations. He can carry spanner. Use spanner to tighten nuts at gate. After tightening, spanner becomes not useable. So cannot use again. But we have multiple spanners. We can use spanner1 to tighten nut1, spanner3 to tighten nut2, spanner4 to tighten nut3. But spanner3 is at location1, same as spanner
