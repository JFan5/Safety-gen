analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have initial state: bob at shed. spanner1 and spanner2 at location1. Both useable. nut1 and nut2 loose at gate. Links: shed-location1, location3-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> gate. So bob must walk from shed to location1, then to location2, then to location3, then to gate. He cannot return to shed. He can pick up spanner at location1. He can use spanner to tighten nuts at gate. He must tighten nut1 before nut2. He can use either spanner. Useable spanner becomes not useable after tightening a nut. So after tightening first nut, the spanner becomes not useable. But we have two spanners. So we can use spanner1 to tighten nut1, then spanner2 to tighten nut2. But spanner2 is also useable initially. But after using spanner1, it becomes not useable. But spanner2 remains use
