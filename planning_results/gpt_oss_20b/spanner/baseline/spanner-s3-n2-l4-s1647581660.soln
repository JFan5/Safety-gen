analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
walk: from start to end if link exists. Effect: bob moves.
pickup_spanner: at location l, if bob at l and spanner at l, then bob picks up spanner: not at spanner at l, carrying bob spanner.
tighten_nut: at location l, bob at l, nut at l, bob carrying spanner s, spanner useable, nut loose. Effect: loose nut removed, useable spanner becomes not useable, tightened nut.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed after leaving? Actually at-most-once means Bob can be at shed at most once. Since Bob starts at shed, he cannot go back to shed again. So Bob must not return to shed after leaving. So we must plan path that doesn't return to shed.
Also we have link graph: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> gate. So path from shed to gate via location1-2-3-4.
Spanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location3. All useable.
Nut1 at gate, loose. Nut2 at gate, loose.
Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1, then location2, location3, location4, gate. But we need to pick up a spanner at some location to tighten nuts. Spanner must be useable. After using, spanner becomes not useable. So we need to use two spanners? Actually we have three spanners. We can use spanner2 at location1, spanner1 or sp3 at location3. But spanner2 is at location1, spanner1 and sp3 at location3. We need to tighten both nuts at gate. So Bob must get to gate with a spanner
