analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable. Objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3 (spanner), nut1, nut2 (nut), location1-4, shed, gate.
Predicates: at ?m ?l (man or spanner at location), carrying ?m ?s (man carrying spanner), useable ?s, link ?l1 ?l2, tightened ?n, loose ?n.
Actions:
walk: from start to end if link exists. Effect: bob moves.
pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, bob at l. After, spanner not at l, bob carrying s.
tighten_nut: at location l, bob at l, nut at l, bob carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: loose n removed, useable s removed, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints: (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)) meaning nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So Bob cannot return to shed after leaving. So Bob must start at shed, then go to location1, etc. He cannot go back to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider spanner positions: spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location1. All useable.
Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1 via link shed-location1. Then he can pick up a spanner at location1 (spanner2 or spanner3). He must tighten nut1 at gate? Wait nut1 at gate. Bob must go to gate to tighten nut1. But Bob cannot go back to shed. He can go from location1 to location2 to location3 to location4 to gate. But link location4 gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. He can walk along links.
But spanner must be at location where nut is. Nut1 at gate. So Bob must bring spanner to gate. He can pick up
