analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: parameters (?start - location ?end - location ?m - man). Precondition: at ?m ?start and link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man). Precondition: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man ?n - nut). Precondition: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Problem: objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3, nut1, nut2, location1-4, shed, gate.
Initial state:
- at bob shed
- at spanner1 location2
- useable spanner1
- at spanner2 location1
- useable spanner2
- at spanner3 location1
- useable spanner3
- loose nut1
- at nut1 gate
- loose nut2
- at nut2 gate
- link shed location1
- link location4 gate
- link location1 location2
- link location2 location3
- link location3 location4
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2)
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed))
So Bob can only be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must leave shed and never return.
Also constraint: tightened nut1 must happen before tightened nut2. So we must tighten nut1 first, then nut2.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to pick spanner(s) to tighten nuts. Spanners are at location1 or location2. Nuts are at
