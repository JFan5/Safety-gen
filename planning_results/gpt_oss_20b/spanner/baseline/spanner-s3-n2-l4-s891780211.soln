analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 3 spanners at locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1. All useable initially. Bob at shed. Nuts at gate. Links: shed- location1, location4-gate, location1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. He can pick up spanner at location where spanner is. He must use a spanner to tighten nuts. Useable spanner becomes not useable after tightening. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 3 spanners, 2 nuts. So we can use spanner1 or spanner2 or spanner3. But we need to tighten nut1 first, then nut2. We can use same spanner for both? No, because useable becomes false after first use. So we need two spanners. We have 3 spanners, so fine.
Plan: Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1 (link).
