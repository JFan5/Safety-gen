analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1? Actually link shed location1. So Bob can walk to location1. Then to location2, location3, location4. Spanners are at location4, location1, location3. Nuts are at gate. Wait nuts are at gate. But nuts are at gate location. But we need to tighten nuts at location? The nuts are at gate. But we need to tighten them. But the action tighten_nut requires at ?n ?l. So the nut must be at the same location as the man. So Bob must be at gate to tighten nuts. But the nuts are at gate. So Bob must go to gate. But link location4 gate, location3 location4, etc. So Bob can walk to gate via location4. But we need to pick up spanner at location4? Actually spanner1 at location4. So Bob can walk to location4, pick up spanner1, then walk to gate, tighten nuts. But we need to use spanner1 to tighten nuts. But spanner1 is useable initially. After using it, it becomes not use
