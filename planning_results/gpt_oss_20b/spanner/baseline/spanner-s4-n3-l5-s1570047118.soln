analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, carrying s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving? He can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot go back to shed. So plan must not have bob return to shed after leaving.
We need to tighten all nuts at gate location. All nuts are at gate. Spanners are at various locations: spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location4, spanner4 at location5. Useable spanners. Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1? Wait link: shed -> location1. So Bob can walk to location1. Then location1 -> location2, etc. He can walk to location2 to pick up spanner1. Then to location4 to pick up spanner2 or spanner3. Then to location5 to pick up spanner4. He must tighten nuts at gate. But spanners are not at gate. He must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are at locations 2,4,4,5. He can walk to gate via location5? Wait link: location5 -> gate. So to reach gate, Bob must walk from location5 to gate. So he can pick up spanner at
