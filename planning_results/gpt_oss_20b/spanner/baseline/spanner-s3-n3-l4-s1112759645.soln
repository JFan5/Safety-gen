analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1, location2, location3, location4, gate? Wait, the link graph: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> gate. So path from shed to gate: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1, then location2, etc. He must pick up spanners at location1 or location3. Spanners at location1: spanner1 and spanner3. spanner2 at location3. All spanners are useable initially. He can pick up a spanner, use it to tighten nuts at gate. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate, pick up a spanner, tighten nuts. But he must use a spanner that is useable. After tightening a nut, the spanner becomes not useable. So he must pick up a new spanner for each nut. There are 3 spanners, 3 nuts. So he can use each spanner for one nut. But spanner
