analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, carrying s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut2) (tightened nut3). So nut2 must be tightened before nut3.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 4 spanners at location4 (spanner1, spanner2, spanner4) and spanner3 at location2. All spanners are useable initially. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed -> location1, location1->location2->location3->location4->location5. Also location5->gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> location5 -> gate. Bob must go to gate to pick up spanners? Actually spanners are at location4 and location2. Bob must walk to those locations to pick up spanners and tighten nuts at gate.
Goal: tighten all nuts at gate. So Bob must go to gate, pick up spanner(s), tighten nuts.
Constraints: Bob can only be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he can leave shed and never return. That's fine.
We need to produce a plan that uses spanners to tighten nuts. Each spanner can be used once? Actually useable predicate indicates spanner is useable. After tightening, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once
