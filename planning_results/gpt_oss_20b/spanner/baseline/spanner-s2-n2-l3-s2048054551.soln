analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving? Actually at-most-once means at most one time. So if he starts at shed, that's one time. He cannot go back to shed again. So he must not return to shed after leaving. So plan must avoid returning to shed.
We need to tighten both nuts. They are at gate. Spanners are at location3. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> gate. He can walk along these links.
He must pick up a spanner at location3. He can pick up either spanner1 or spanner2. Useable spanner1 and spanner2. Useable means can be used. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used once. He needs to tighten both nuts. He can use spanner1 for nut1, spanner2 for nut2. But after using, useable becomes false. But we don't need to use same spanner again. So we can use spanner1 for nut1, spanner2 for nut2. But we
