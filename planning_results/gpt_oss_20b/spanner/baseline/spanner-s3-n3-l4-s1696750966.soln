analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l and at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have 3 nuts at gate. Spanners at locations: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location4, spanner3 at location3. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed-location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. So Bob can walk along that path.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Use spanners. Each spanner can be used once? Actually useable predicate indicates spanner is usable. After using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. But we have 3 nuts and 3 spanners. So each spanner can be used to tighten one nut. But we need to satisfy constraint: nut1 before nut2. So we need to tighten nut1 first, then nut2, then nut3. But we also need to use spanners accordingly.
We need to plan: Bob picks up spanner1 at location1, use to tighten nut1 at gate? Wait sp
