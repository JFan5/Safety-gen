analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: parameters (?start - location ?end - location ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: parameters (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man ?n - nut). Preconditions: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Problem: objects: bob (man), spanner1, spanner2, spanner3 (spanner), nut1, nut2 (nut), location1-4, shed, gate.
Initial state:
- at bob shed
- at spanner1 location2
- useable spanner1
- at spanner2 location2
- useable spanner2
- at spanner3 location2
- useable spanner3
- loose nut1
- at nut1 gate
- loose nut2
- at nut2 gate
- link shed location1
- link location4 gate
- link location1 location2
- link location2 location3
- link location3 location4
Goal: tightened nut1 and tightened nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2) meaning nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We need to consider that Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1, location2, location3, location4, gate. The nuts are at gate. Spanners are at location2. So Bob must walk to location
