analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
3. tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1? Let's see links: link shed location1, location1 location2, location2 location3, location3 location4, location4 gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Spanners are at location2 (spanner1 and spanner3) and location4 (spanner2). Nuts are at gate. So Bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. He needs a spanner to tighten nuts. He can pick up a spanner at location2 or location4. Useable spanners: spanner1, spanner2, spanner3. Useable spanner is a property that must hold for tightening. After tightening, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. So we need to use spanner1 or spanner3 for nut1, spanner2 for nut2, spanner3 for nut3? But we have only 3 spanners. We can use each once. But we need to tighten all 3 nuts. We have 3 spanners. So we can use each spanner
