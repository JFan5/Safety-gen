analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
3. tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving? Actually at-most-once means he can be at shed at most once. So if he starts at shed, he cannot return to shed again. So he must leave shed and never return.
Also we have link graph: shed -> location1, location1 -> location2, location2 -> location3, location3 -> location4, location4 -> location5, location5 -> gate. So path from shed to gate via location1-5.
Spanners: spanner1 at location1, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location5, spanner4 at location4. All useable.
Nuts: nut1, nut2, nut3 at gate, loose.
Goal: tighten all nuts. Need to use spanner to tighten each nut. Useable spanner becomes not useable after tightening a nut. So each spanner can be used only once. We have 4 spanners, 3 nuts. So we can use any spanner.
Constraints: must tighten nut1 before nut2. No constraint on nut3 relative to others.
Plan: Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1, then to location2
