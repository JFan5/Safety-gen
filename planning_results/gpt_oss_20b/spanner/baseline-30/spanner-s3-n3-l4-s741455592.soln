analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So plan must not have him go back to shed after leaving.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.
We have spanners at location2 (spanner1 and spanner3) and location4 (spanner2). Bob starts at shed. He must walk to location1 (link shed location1). Then to location2, location3, location4. Nuts are at gate. Wait: nuts at gate. But nuts are at gate location. But we need to tighten nuts at gate. But spanners are at location2 or location4. So Bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are not at gate. So Bob must pick up spanner at location2 or location4, then walk to gate, then tighten nuts. But spanner must be useable. Useable spanner1, spanner2, spanner3. But after using, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. But we need to tighten 3 nuts. We have 3 spanners. So we can use each spanner to tighten one nut. But we need to satisfy constraint: nut1 before nut2. So we can
