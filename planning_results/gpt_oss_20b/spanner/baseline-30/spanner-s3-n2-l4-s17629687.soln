analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So plan must not have him go back to shed after leaving.
We need to plan actions to tighten both nuts. They are at gate initially. Spanners at location3 and location4. Bob at shed. Links: shed->location1, location1->location2, location2->location3, location3->location4, location4->gate. So path from shed to gate: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1, then location2, etc. He cannot return to shed. So he must go to gate eventually.
We need to pick up a spanner at some location, use it to tighten nuts. Spanners are useable initially. Useable spanner can be used to tighten a nut, after which it becomes not useable. So each spanner can be used once. We have 3 spanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location4. So we can use spanner1 or spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location4. We need to tighten both nuts at gate. So we
