analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
1. walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
2. pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
3. tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not walk back to shed after leaving. So plan must avoid returning to shed.
We need to tighten both nuts. They are at gate initially. Spanners at locations: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location3, spanner3 at location1. Bob starts at shed. Links: shed-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-gate. So path from shed to gate: shed -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> gate. Bob can walk along these links.
Goal: tighten nut1 and nut2 at gate. He needs a spanner at gate to tighten. Spanners are at different locations. He can walk to a spanner location, pick up spanner, walk to gate, tighten nuts. But spanner must be useable. After use, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. We need to tighten both nuts. We have 3 spanners. So we can use two spanners to tighten both nuts. But we must satisfy constraints: at-most-once at shed. Bob starts at shed. He
