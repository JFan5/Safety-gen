analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at ?m ?l, at ?s ?l. Effect: not at ?s ?l, carrying ?m ?s.
- tighten_nut: at ?m ?l, at ?n ?l, carrying ?m ?s, useable ?s, loose ?n. Effect: not loose ?n, not useable ?s, tightened ?n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He can walk to location1 via link shed location1. Then he can pick up spanner1 at location1. Use spanner1 to tighten nut1 at gate? Wait nut1 is at gate. But spanner1 is at location1. So Bob must walk to gate to tighten nut1. But spanner1 is at location1, not at gate. He can walk to gate via link? Let's see links: link location5 gate, link location1 location2, location2 location3, location3 location4, location4 location5. So path from location1 to gate: location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> location5 -> gate. So Bob can walk from location1 to gate. But spanner1 is at location1. He can pick it up at location1, then walk to gate carrying spanner1. But spanner1 is useable. After tightening nut1, spanner1 becomes not useable. So cannot use again. But we need to tighten nut2 and nut3. We have spanner2 at location5, spanner3
