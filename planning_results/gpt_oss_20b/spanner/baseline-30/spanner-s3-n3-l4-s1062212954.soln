analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, at spanner s at l, at man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, at spanner s at l, at man m at l, carrying m s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So after leaving shed, he cannot return to shed again.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. We must ensure that bob does not return to shed after leaving. So we must start at shed, then go to location1, etc. He cannot go back to shed. So we must not include any walk back to shed.
We need to tighten all nuts. They are at gate. Spanners are at location2, location1, location4. We need to pick up spanner(s) and tighten nuts. Useable spanner1, spanner2, spanner3. Useable spanner1 at location2, spanner2 at location1, spanner3 at location4.
We need to tighten nut1, nut2, nut3. They are at gate. So we need to walk from shed to location1, then to location2, location3, location4, gate? Wait, link: location4 gate. So gate is connected to location4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. But we need to tighten nuts at gate. So we need to walk to gate. But we cannot go back to shed
