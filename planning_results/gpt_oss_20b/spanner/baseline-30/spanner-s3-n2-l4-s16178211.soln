analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, man m at l, spanner s at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, man m at l, nut n at l, carrying spanner s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1 and nut2.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Since only one man bob, he can be at shed at most once. He starts at shed. So he cannot return to shed after leaving. So he must not go back to shed after leaving. So plan must not include walking back to shed after leaving.
Also at-most-once (at ?m shed) means that the predicate at ?m shed can be true at most once. Since initial state has bob at shed, that's one occurrence. After he leaves, he cannot return to shed. So we must not have any action that puts bob back at shed.
Also we must satisfy link constraints: links: shed- location1, location4-gate, location1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. Also location4-gate link.
Spanners: spanner1 at location4, spanner2 at location2, spanner3 at location1. All useable.
Nuts: nut1 at gate, loose; nut2 at gate, loose.
Goal: tighten both nuts. Must tighten nut1 before nut2.
We need to pick spanner to tighten nuts. Use spanner to tighten nut. Useable spanner must be used to tighten nut; after use, useable becomes false. So each sp
