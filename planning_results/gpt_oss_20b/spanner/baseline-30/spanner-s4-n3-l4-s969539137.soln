analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: spanner. Types: location, locatable, man, nut, spanner. Predicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.
Actions:
- walk: from start to end if link exists. Preconditions: at ?m ?start, link ?start ?end. Effect: not at ?m ?start, at ?m ?end.
- pickup_spanner: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l. Effect: not at s l, carrying m s.
- tighten_nut: at location l, spanner s at l, man m at l, carrying s, useable s, loose n. Effect: not loose n, not useable s, tightened n.
Goal: tightened nut1, nut2, nut3.
Constraints:
- sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2.
- forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)). Means each man can be at shed at most once. Bob starts at shed. So Bob can only be at shed once. So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints. Bob starts at shed. He must go to location1? Wait, link shed location1. So Bob can walk to location1. Then to location2, location3, location4, gate? Actually link location4 gate. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> location4 -> gate. But spanners are at location2, location3, location1, location1. Nuts are at gate. So Bob must go to gate to tighten nuts. But spanners are at locations 1,2,3. He can pick up spanner at location1 or 2 or 3. He needs to use spanner to tighten nuts at gate. But spanner must be at same location as nut to tighten. So Bob must walk to gate with spanner. But spanner is at location1 or 2 or 3. He can walk to gate via location4. But spanner must be carried. So he must pick up spanner at some location, then walk to gate, then tighten nuts.
But spanner must be useable. All spanners are useable initially. But after using, useable becomes false
