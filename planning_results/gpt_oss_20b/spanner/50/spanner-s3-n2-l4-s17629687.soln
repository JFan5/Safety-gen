The domain includes three action types: walk, pickup_spanner, and tighten_nut. The problem has:
- Objects:
- Men: bob
- Spanners: spanner1, spanner2, spanner3
- Nuts: nut1, nut2
- Locations: location1, location2, location3, location4, shed, gate
- Initial state:
- at bob shed
- at spanner1 location3
useable spanner1
- at spanner2 location3
useable spanner2
- at spanner3 location4
useable spanner3
- loose nut1
at nut1 gate
- loose nut2
at nut2 gate
- link shed location1
- link location4 gate
- link location1 location2
- link location2 location3
- link location3 location4
- Goal:
- tightened nut1
- tightened nut2
- Constraints (PDDL3):
- (sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2))
- (forall (?m - man) (at-most-once (at ?m shed)))
So nut1 must be tightened before nut2, and each man (bob) can be at shed at most once during the whole plan.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and the constraints. The plan must use only the defined objects. The action parameters must match the types:
- walk: (?start - location ?end - location ?m - man)
- pickup_spanner: (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man)
- tighten_nut: (?l - location ?s - spanner ?m - man ?n - nut)
We must ensure:
- For pickup_spanner, spanner must be
