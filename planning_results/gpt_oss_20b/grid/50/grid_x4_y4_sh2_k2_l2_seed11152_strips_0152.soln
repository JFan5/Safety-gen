analysisThe domain defines five actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint: (:constraints (always (not (at-robot pos2-3)))). So the robot must never be at pos2-3. The goal: key0 at pos1-0 and key1 at pos3-3. Initial states: robot at pos2-0; key0 at pos2-1; key1 at pos0-3; pos3-0 and pos3-1 are locked with shapes shape0 and shape1 respectively; key0 has shape0; key1 has shape1; pos3-0 lock-shape shape0; pos3-1 lock-shape shape1. So key0 can unlock pos3-0; key1 can unlock pos3-1. pos3-3 is open initially. So to get key1 to pos3-3, we might need to unlock pos3-1? Actually key1 is at pos0-3; pos3-3 is open; we need to move robot to pos3-3 and then pickup key1 there? Wait key1 is at pos0-3 initially. The goal requires key1 at pos3-3. So we need to move key1 from pos0-3 to pos3-3. That requires robot to travel from its current location to pos0-3, pickup key1,
