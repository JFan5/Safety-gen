analysisWe need to produce a plan for the grid-5-5-3-4-4 domain. Let's restate:
Places: pos0-0 ... pos4-4 (5x5 grid). Shapes: shape0, shape1, shape2. Keys: key0, key1, key2, key3.
Lock-shape: pos2-0 shape0; pos0-1 shape1; pos4-0 shape2; pos1-4 shape2.
Initially locked: pos2-0, pos0-1, pos4-0, pos1-4. Open: all other places.
Key-shape: key0 shape0; key1 shape1; key2 shape2; key3 shape2.
Keys at: key0 pos1-3; key1 pos1-0; key2 pos4-1; key3 pos2-1.
Robot at: pos1-1. Arm empty.
Goal: key0 at pos3-4; key1 at pos3-2; key3 at pos4-3.
Constraints: (always (not (at-robot pos1-2))) So robot must never be at pos1-2.
Also PDDL3 constraints? Only that one. So plan must avoid pos1-2.
We must move robot, pickup keys, put them at goal locations. No locks involved in goal except we must avoid pos1-2. Also we must not unlock any locks unless needed? But maybe we need to unlock pos1-4? Goal requires key3 at pos4-3. Key3 is shape2. pos4-3 is open initially? Let's check: pos4-3 is open initially (open pos4-3). Good. pos3-4 is open. pos3-2 is open. So goal places are open. So we don't need to unlock any locks for goal. But we might need to unlock pos1-4 or pos2-0 or pos0-1 or pos4-0 if robot or keys need to pass through them. Let's see paths:
Goal for key0: pos3-4. Key0 starts at pos1-3. Path: pos1-3 -> pos2-3 -> pos3-3 -> pos3-4. Check if any of these are locked: pos2-3 open; pos3-3 open; pos3-4 open. So no locks.
Goal for key1: pos3-2. Key
