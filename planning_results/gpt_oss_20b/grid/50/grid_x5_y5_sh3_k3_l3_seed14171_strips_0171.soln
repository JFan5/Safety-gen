commentaryWe must produce a plan for the grid domain. Let's analyze the problem.
Grid size 5x5 positions pos0-0 ... pos4-4. Shapes: shape0, shape1, shape2. Keys: key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape2.
Locked positions:
- pos2-3 lock shape0
- pos4-2 lock shape1
- pos2-4 lock shape2
Open positions: all except pos2-3, pos4-2, pos2-4. Also pos0-0 etc. So only those three are locked.
Goal:
- key0 at pos4-4
- key1 at pos0-2
- key2 at pos4-0
Robot start at pos2-1, arm empty.
Constraints:
- always (not (at-robot pos1-2)). So robot must never be at pos1-2. That's a PDDL3 constraint. So plan must avoid pos1-2 entirely.
We need to move keys to goal positions. Keys currently:
- key0 at pos3-2
- key1 at pos1-0
- key2 at pos1-3
Goal positions:
- key0 pos4-4
- key1 pos0-2
- key2 pos4-0
We must consider locked positions that might lie on paths or goal positions. None of goal positions are locked: pos4-4 open, pos0-2 open, pos4-0 open. So keys can be moved through locked cells if we unlock them. But we must unlock pos2-3 (shape0), pos4-2 (shape1), pos2-4 (shape2). These correspond to keys shapes: key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape2. So each locked cell requires the corresponding key shape to unlock.
Thus we need to unlock pos2-3 using key0, pos4-2 using key1, pos2-4 using key2. But keys themselves are at positions that might be near these locks. Let's check:
- pos2-3 is adjacent to pos1-3, pos2-4, pos3-3. Key2 is at pos1-3. So key2 is adjacent to pos2-4 (locked shape2) and pos1-3 (open). So key2 can unlock pos2-4 directly.
- pos2-3 also adjacent to pos1-
