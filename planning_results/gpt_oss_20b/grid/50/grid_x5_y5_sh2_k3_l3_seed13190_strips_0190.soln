analysisWe need to parse the domain and problem, then generate a plan that moves key0 to pos0-1, key1 to pos0-2, key2 to pos0-3, starting from robot at pos2-0, keys at pos2-1, pos4-2, pos4-4. Locks: pos4-1 shape0 locked, pos3-1 shape1 locked, pos3-4 shape0 locked. But goal positions are pos0-1, pos0-2, pos0-3, which are open. So we don't need to unlock any locks. However, we must consider the PDDL3 constraint: always (not (at-robot pos3-3)). So robot must never be at pos3-3. That location is connected to pos2-3, pos3-2, pos4-3. All those are open. So we must avoid stepping into pos3-3. That's fine.
We need to plan path for robot to pick up key0 at pos2-1, bring to pos0-1; pick up key1 at pos4-2, bring to pos0-2; pick up key2 at pos4-4, bring to pos0-3. The robot can carry only one key at a time (arm-empty / holding). So we need to sequence: maybe go to key0, pickup, bring to pos0-1, putdown; then go to key1, pickup, bring to pos0-2, putdown; then go to key2, pickup, bring to pos0-3, putdown. We must ensure robot never goes to pos3-3. Also we must ensure that during movement, the next position is open. All positions except pos3-1, pos4-1, pos3-4 are open. pos3-1 is locked shape1; pos4-1 locked shape0; pos3-4 locked shape0. So those positions are locked and cannot be moved into unless open. Since they are locked and shape doesn't match any key's shape? key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape1. pos3-1 lock-shape shape1; pos4-1 shape0; pos3-4 shape0. So keys could unlock them: key0 shape0 could unlock pos4-1; key1 shape1 could unlock pos3-1; key2 shape1 could unlock pos3-1 as well. But
