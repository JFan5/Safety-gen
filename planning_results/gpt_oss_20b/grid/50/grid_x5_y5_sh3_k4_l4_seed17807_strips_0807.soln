analysisWe need to produce a plan for the grid domain. Let's restate the problem:
Objects:
Places: pos0-0 pos0-1 pos0-2 pos0-3 pos0-4
pos1-0 pos1-1 pos1-2 pos1-3 pos1-4
pos2-0 pos2-1 pos2-2 pos2-3 pos2-4
pos3-0 pos3-1 pos3-2 pos3-3 pos3-4
pos4-0 pos4-1 pos4-2 pos4-3 pos4-4
Shapes: shape0 shape1 shape2
Keys: key0 key1 key2 key3
Predicates:
- conn ?x ?y : place connectivity (bidirectional? In init, conn pos0-0 pos1-0 and also pos1-0 pos0-0? Let's check: I see (conn pos0-0 pos1-0) but not (conn pos1-0 pos0-1). Wait, there is (conn pos1-0 pos0-0). Yes, they include both directions for each pair. So conn is symmetric but defined explicitly.
- key-shape ?k ?s
- lock-shape ?x ?s
- at ?r ?x : key or lock at place
- at-robot ?x : robot at place
- place ?p
- key ?k
- shape ?s
- locked ?x : lock at place
- holding ?k : robot holding key
- open ?x : lock at place
- arm-empty : robot's arm empty
Actions:
unlock:
params: (?curpos ?lockpos ?key ?shape)
precond: place curpos, place lockpos, key key, shape shape,
conn curpos lockpos,
key-shape key shape,
lock-shape lockpos shape,
at-robot curpos,
locked lockpos,
holding key
effect: open lockpos, not locked lockpos
move:
params: (?curpos ?nextpos)
precond: place curpos, place nextpos,
at-robot curpos,
conn curpos nextpos,
open nextpos
effect: at-robot nextpos, not at-robot curpos
pickup:
params: (?curpos ?key)
precond: place curpos, key key,
at-robot curpos
