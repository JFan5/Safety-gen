analysisWe need to generate a plan for the grid-6-6-3-4-4 domain. Let's restate the domain:
- Places: pos0-0 ... pos5-5 (6x6 grid)
- Shapes: shape0 shape1 shape2
- Keys: key0 key1 key2 key3
- Predicates:
- conn X Y: X and Y are places that are connected (adjacent)
- key-shape K S: key K has shape S
- lock-shape P S: place P has lock shape S
- at R P: robot R is at place P
- at-robot P: robot is at place P (alias)
- place P: P is a place
- key K: K is a key
- shape S: S is a shape
- locked P: place P is locked
- at K P: key K is at place P
- holding K: robot holds key K
- open P: place P's lock is open
- arm-empty: robot's arm is empty
- Actions:
1. unlock
params: curpos lockpos key shape
precond: place curpos, place lockpos, key key, shape shape,
conn curpos lockpos,
key-shape key shape,
lock-shape lockpos shape,
at-robot curpos,
locked lockpos,
holding key
effect: open lockpos, not locked lockpos
2. move
params: curpos nextpos
precond: place curpos, place nextpos,
at-robot curpos,
conn curpos nextpos,
open nextpos
effect: at-robot nextpos, not at-robot curpos
3. pickup
params: curpos key
precond: place curpos, key key,
at-robot curpos,
at key curpos,
arm-empty
effect: holding key, not at key curpos, not arm-empty
4. pickup-and-loose
params: curpos newkey oldkey
precond: place curpos, key newkey, key oldkey,
at-robot curpos,
holding oldkey,
at newkey curpos
effect: holding newkey,
at oldkey curpos,
not holding old
