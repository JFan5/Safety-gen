analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to achieve goal: (at key1 pos3-2). Initially key1 at pos1-1. We need to move key1 to pos3-2. We have robot at pos1-1. We can pick up key1, move robot to pos3-2, put down key1. But need to ensure constraints: always (not (at-robot pos2-2)). So robot cannot be at pos2-2 at any time. Also we must consider locked positions: pos3-1, pos0-1, pos0-3, pos2-2 are locked initially. But open status: open pos3-2 is open. So robot can move to pos3-2. But need to ensure connectivity: we need path from pos1-1 to pos3-2 that doesn't go through pos2-2. Let's examine connections.
Connections list:
- pos1-1 connected to pos2-1, pos1-2, pos0-1, pos1-0.
- pos2-1 connected to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1, pos2-0.
- pos3-1 connected to pos4-1, pos3-2, pos2-1, pos3-0.
- pos3-2 connected to pos4-2, pos3-3, pos2-2, pos3-1.
- pos3-3 connected to pos4-3, pos3-4, pos2-3, pos3-2.
- pos3-4 connected to pos4-4, pos3-3, pos2-4, pos3-3.
- pos2-2 is locked initially. But we can unlock it by unlocking with key shape1? Wait lock-shape pos2-2 shape1. So to unlock pos2-2, we need key with shape1. Key1 has shape1. So we can unlock pos2-2 by using key1. But we need to get key1 to pos2-2 to unlock it. But key1 is at pos1-1. We need to move key1 to pos2-2. But we want to eventually move key1 to pos3-2. But we might need to unlock pos2-2 to pass through it. But we cannot be at pos2-2 due to constraint. So we cannot be at pos2-2 at any time
