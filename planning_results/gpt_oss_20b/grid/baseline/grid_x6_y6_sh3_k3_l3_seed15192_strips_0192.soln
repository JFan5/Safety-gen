analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: key1 at pos4-4 and key2 at pos4-5. Initially key1 at pos3-3, key2 at pos2-5. Robot at pos5-1. We need to move robot to pick up keys and put down at target positions. Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-4)). So robot cannot be at pos3-4 at any time. Also we must respect locked positions: pos5-0, pos0-2, pos4-1 are locked initially. We can unlock them by unlocking action if we have key matching shape. We have keys shapes: key0 shape0, key1 shape1, key2 shape2. Lock shapes: pos5-0 shape0, pos0-2 shape1, pos4-1 shape2. So we can unlock pos5-0 with key0, pos0-2 with key1, pos4-1 with key2. But we don't need to unlock those locked positions because goal doesn't involve them. But we might need to pass through them? The robot starts at pos5-1. To reach pos4-4 and pos4-5, we need to navigate grid. Let's examine connectivity. We need to move robot to pos4-4 and pos4-5. Are those positions reachable from pos5-1? Let's see connections: pos5-1 connected to pos5-2, pos4-1, pos5-0. pos4-1 is locked initially. So cannot go through pos4-1 unless unlocked. But we can unlock pos4-1 with key2 shape2. But key2 is at pos2-5. So we need to get key2 to unlock pos4-1. But we need key2 at pos4-5 eventually. So maybe we can unlock pos4-1, then move to pos4-5, then pick up key2 and put down at pos4-5. But we also need key1 at pos4-4. Key1 is at pos3-3 initially. We need to move key1 to pos4-4. That might require unlocking pos4-1? Not necessarily. Let's analyze connectivity to pos4-4. pos4-4 is open. It is connected to pos3-4, pos4-5, pos5-4. pos3-4 is open. pos5-4 is open. So robot
