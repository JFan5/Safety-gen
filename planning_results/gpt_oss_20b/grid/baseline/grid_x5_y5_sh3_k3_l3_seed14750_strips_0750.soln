analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: key0 at pos3-2 and key1 at pos0-1. Initially key0 at pos4-1, key1 at pos2-3, key2 at pos4-3. Robot at pos4-0. Locked positions: pos0-3, pos1-2, pos3-1. Open positions: all except those locked. We need to move robot to pick up key0 and move to pos3-2, and key1 to pos0-1. Also constraints: always (not (at-robot pos4-2)). So robot cannot be at pos4-2 at any time. So we must avoid that.
We have actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. We need to pick up keys and move them.
We need to plan path for robot. Let's map grid positions: 5x5 grid positions pos0-0 to pos4-4. Robot starts at pos4-0. We need to get key0 from pos4-1 to pos3-2. Key1 from pos2-3 to pos0-1. Key2 is irrelevant.
We need to ensure robot never at pos4-2. So avoid that.
We need to consider connectivity: connections list. Let's list connections for relevant positions.
Connections:
pos4-0 connected to pos3-0 and pos4-1. pos4-1 connected to pos4-2, pos3-1, pos4-0. pos4-2 connected to pos4-3, pos3-2, pos4-1. pos4-3 connected to pos4-4, pos3-3, pos4-2. pos4-4 connected to pos3-4, pos4-3.
We need to avoid pos4-2. So robot cannot go there. So we can go from pos4-0 to pos4-1, then to pos3-1, etc.
We need to get key0 from pos4-1 to pos3-2. Path: robot at pos4-0, go to pos4-1, pick up key0, then move to pos3-2. But pos3-2 is connected to pos4-2, pos3-1, pos2-2. But pos4-2 is forbidden. So we can go from pos4-1 to pos3-1 to pos3-2
