analysisWe need to produce a valid plan to move key1 from pos1-5 to pos4-3. The robot starts at pos3-3. The robot can move along connections. The goal is to have key1 at pos4-3. We must obey constraint: always not at pos2-3. So robot cannot be at pos2-3 at any time.
We need to pick up key1 at pos1-5, then move to pos4-3, then put down. But we must ensure that we don't go through pos2-3. Let's examine connections: pos1-5 connects to pos2-5, pos0-5, pos1-4. pos2-5 connects to pos3-5, pos1-5, pos2-4. pos3-5 connects to pos4-5, pos2-5, pos3-4. pos4-5 connects to pos5-5, pos3-5, pos4-4. pos5-5 is locked. pos4-4 is open. pos4-4 connects to pos5-4, pos4-5, pos4-3. pos4-3 connects to pos5-3, pos4-4, pos4-2. pos4-2 is locked. So to reach pos4-3, we can go from pos4-4 to pos4-3. So path: pos1-5 -> pos2-5 -> pos3-5 -> pos4-5 -> pos4-4 -> pos4-3. But we must avoid pos2-3. That path doesn't go through pos2-3. Good.
We need to ensure that all positions are open. Are they? pos2-5 open, pos3-5 open, pos4-5 open, pos4-4 open, pos4-3 open. Yes.
We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: robot cannot be at pos2-3 at any time. So we avoid that.
We also need to ensure that we don't violate locked positions: pos5-1, pos4-2, pos5-5, pos5-4 are locked. We won't go there.
We need to ensure that we don't violate any other constraints: none.
We need to ensure that we don't violate any preconditions: For unlock action, we need to unlock locked positions. But we don't need to unlock anything.
