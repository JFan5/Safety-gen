analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos2-1. Keys: key0 at pos3-1, key1 at pos1-0, key2 at pos0-0. Locked positions: pos2-3, pos3-3, pos3-2. lock-shape: pos2-3 shape0, pos3-3 shape1, pos3-2 shape1. open positions: many open except locked ones.
Goal: key1 at pos2-2, key2 at pos3-1.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-1)). So robot cannot be at pos1-1 at any time.
We need to move keys to goal positions.
We need to consider that keys can be moved by picking up and putting down. The robot can move between positions via move action, but cannot go to pos1-1. Also, some positions are locked; but open positions are open. The locked positions are pos2-3, pos3-3, pos3-2. They are locked initially. To move keys to those positions, we need to unlock them first. But the goal requires key1 at pos2-2 (open) and key2 at pos3-1 (open). So we don't need to unlock locked positions. But we might need to move keys through locked positions? Let's see.
Key1 starts at pos1-0. Key2 starts at pos0-0. Key0 at pos3-1. We need to move key1 to pos2-2, key2 to pos3-1. Key0 is irrelevant.
We need to pick up key1 at pos1-0, move robot to pos2-2, put down key1. Similarly for key2: pick up key2 at pos0-0, move robot to pos3-1, put down key2.
But we must ensure robot never goes to pos1-1. Let's check connectivity: pos1-0 connects to pos2-0, pos1-1, pos0-0. pos1-1 connects to pos2-1, pos1-2, pos
