analysisWe need to produce a plan that moves key0 from pos4-1 to pos1-1. The robot starts at pos5-3. There are locked positions: pos4-3, pos1-2, pos5-0. The robot cannot be at pos4-2 (constraint). Also, the robot must be at open positions. The robot can move along connections. The robot can pick up key0 at pos4-1, then move to pos1-1, then put down key. But need to ensure that key0 is at pos1-1 at goal. Also, we must ensure that robot never at pos4-2. Also, we must ensure that robot can move to pos1-1. Let's analyze connectivity.
We have grid positions 0-5 rows and columns. The robot starts at pos5-3. We need to get to pos1-1. Let's see path: pos5-3 -> pos5-2 -> pos5-1 -> pos4-1 -> pos4-0 -> pos3-0 -> pos2-0 -> pos1-0 -> pos1-1. But we must avoid pos4-2. The path above doesn't go through pos4-2. But we need to check connectivity: Are there connections between these positions? Let's check connections list:
- conn pos5-3 pos5-4
- conn pos5-3 pos4-3
- conn pos5-3 pos5-2
So from pos5-3 we can go to pos5-2 or pos4-3 or pos5-4. But pos4-3 is locked. But we can go to pos5-2. Then from pos5-2 to pos5-1 or pos4-2 or pos5-3. But pos4-2 is locked. So we can go to pos5-1. Then from pos5-1 to pos5-2, pos4-1, pos5-0. So we can go to pos4-1. Then from pos4-1 to pos5-1, pos4-2, pos3-1. But pos4-2 is locked. So we can go to pos3-1. Then from pos3-1 to pos4-1, pos3-2, pos2-1. So we can go to pos3-2. Then from pos3-2 to pos4-2, pos3-3
