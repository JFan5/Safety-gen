analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that moves key1 from pos4-0 to pos3-5. The robot starts at pos5-2. There is a constraint: always (not (at-robot pos4-2)). So robot cannot be at pos4-2 at any time. Also, key1 is at pos4-0 initially. We need to get it to pos3-5. The robot can pick up key1 at pos4-0, move to pos3-5, and put down. But we must ensure robot never at pos4-2. Let's examine connectivity: pos4-0 connects to pos5-0, pos4-1, pos3-0. pos4-1 connects to pos5-1, pos4-2, pos3-1. pos4-2 connects to pos5-2, pos4-3, pos3-2. So to go from pos4-0 to pos3-5, we need a path that doesn't go through pos4-2. Let's find a path: pos4-0 -> pos3-0 -> pos3-1 -> pos3-2 -> pos3-3 -> pos3-4 -> pos3-5? But check connections: pos3-0 connects to pos4-0, pos3-1, pos2-0. pos3-1 connects to pos4-1, pos3-2, pos2-1. pos3-2 connects to pos4-2, pos3-3, pos2-2. pos3-3 connects to pos4-3, pos3-4, pos2-3. pos3-4 connects to pos4-4, pos3-5, pos2-4. pos3-5 connects to pos4-5, pos3-4, pos2-5. So path: pos4-0 -> pos3-0 -> pos3-1 -> pos3-2 -> pos3-3 -> pos3-4 -> pos3-5. That path doesn't go through pos4-2. Good.
But we need to ensure robot can move through open positions. All positions are open except locked ones: pos3-1, pos2-1, pos1-3. Those are locked. But our path uses pos3-1, which is locked. Wait, pos3-1 is locked. So robot cannot enter pos3-1 unless unlocked. But we can
