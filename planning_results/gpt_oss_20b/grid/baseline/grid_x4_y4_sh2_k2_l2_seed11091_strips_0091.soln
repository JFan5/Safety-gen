analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos1-3. Keys: key0 at pos0-3, key1 at pos1-2. Locked positions: pos2-1 and pos3-3. lock-shape: pos2-1 shape0, pos3-3 shape1. Goal: key0 at pos1-1, key1 at pos3-3.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos2-3)). So robot cannot be at pos2-3 at any time.
We need to move keys to goal positions. Key0 must go to pos1-1. Key1 must go to pos3-3.
We need to consider locked positions: pos2-1 and pos3-3 are locked initially. To move key1 to pos3-3, we need to unlock pos3-3. But key1 is at pos1-2. To unlock pos3-3, we need a key with shape1 (key1) to unlock lock-shape shape1. But key1 is at pos1-2, not at pos3-3. Wait, unlocking requires holding a key that matches shape of lock. The unlock action requires parameters: ?curpos ?lockpos ?key ?shape. Preconditions: place ?curpos, place ?lockpos, key ?key, shape ?shape, conn ?curpos ?lockpos, key-shape ?key ?shape, lock-shape ?lockpos ?shape, at-robot ?curpos, locked ?lockpos, holding ?key. So to unlock pos3-3, robot must be at some position connected to pos3-3, holding a key that matches shape1. That key must be key1 (shape1). So robot must hold key1 and be at a position connected to pos3-3. Then unlock action will open pos3-3.
But key1 is at pos1-2. So robot must pick up key1, move to a position connected to pos3-3, unlock pos3-3, then move key1 to pos3-3.
Similarly, key0 must go to pos
