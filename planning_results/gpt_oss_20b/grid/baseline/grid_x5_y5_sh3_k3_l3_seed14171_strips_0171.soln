analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos2-1. Keys at pos3-2, pos1-0, pos1-3. Locked positions: pos2-3, pos4-2, pos2-4. Open positions: many open except pos4-2? Wait open pos4-2 not listed; open pos4-2 missing. Also open pos4-2 missing. So pos4-2 is locked. Also pos2-3, pos2-4 locked. So we need to unlock them to move through.
Goal: key0 at pos4-4, key1 at pos0-2, key2 at pos4-0.
We need to move keys to those positions.
We need to consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos1-2)). So robot cannot be at pos1-2 at any time.
We need to plan a sequence of actions that moves keys accordingly.
We need to consider that keys can be moved by picking up and putting down. The robot can carry one key at a time (holding). The robot can move between positions via move action, but only to open positions. Locked positions cannot be entered unless unlocked. The unlock action requires robot at current position, key held, lock shape matches key shape, lock-shape matches shape, and locked. After unlocking, open becomes true and locked false.
We need to move keys to target positions. Let's analyze positions:
Positions grid 5x5: pos0-0 to pos4-4.
We need to move key0 (shape0) to pos4-4. key1 (shape1) to pos0-2. key2 (shape2) to pos4-0.
We need to plan path for robot to pick up keys and move them.
We need to ensure robot never at pos1-2. So we must avoid that.
We need to consider locked positions: pos2-3, pos2-4, pos4-2. These are locked initially. They may block path. We can unlock them if we have matching key shape.
We have keys of shapes 0,1,2.
