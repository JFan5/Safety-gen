analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: key1 at pos5-4 and key2 at pos1-1. Initially key1 at pos1-1 already, key2 at pos2-2. Wait goal says key2 at pos1-1. So need to move key2 from pos2-2 to pos1-1. Also key1 must be at pos5-4. Initially key1 at pos1-1. So need to move key1 to pos5-4. Also constraints: always (not (at-robot pos2-1)). So robot cannot be at pos2-1 at any time. Robot starts at pos4-2. We must plan moves accordingly.
We have actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown. We need to pick up keys and move them.
We need to ensure robot never at pos2-1. So avoid moving to that location.
We need to move key1 from pos1-1 to pos5-4. Path: robot at pos4-2. It can move to pos4-3, pos4-4, pos4-5, pos5-5, pos5-4 etc. But must avoid pos2-1. That's far away.
We also need to move key2 from pos2-2 to pos1-1. That requires robot to go to pos2-2, pick up key2, then move to pos1-1. But robot cannot be at pos2-1. That's fine.
We need to ensure robot can reach pos2-2. Let's check connectivity: pos2-2 connected to pos3-2, pos2-3, pos1-2, pos2-1. So robot can go to pos2-2 via pos3-2 etc. But must avoid pos2-1. So we can go via pos3-2, pos3-1, pos4-1, pos4-2 etc. But we need to ensure robot path doesn't go through pos2-1. That's fine.
We also need to ensure robot can reach pos5-4. Path: pos4-2 to pos4-3 to pos4-4 to pos5-4. That is fine.
We need to ensure robot never at pos2-1. So avoid moving to that location.
We need to plan sequence:
1. Move robot from pos4-2 to pos4-3.
2. Move
