analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: key0 at pos3-5, key2 at pos1-1. Initially key0 at pos3-1, key1 at pos0-5, key2 at pos2-4. Robot at pos0-3. Locked positions: pos4-5, pos1-2, pos4-0. Open positions: all except those locked. So robot can move through open positions. Need to move key0 to pos3-5 and key2 to pos1-1. We can pick up keys, move robot, put down. Need to ensure constraints: always (not (at-robot pos2-1)). So robot cannot be at pos2-1 at any time. So we must avoid moving robot to pos2-1. But robot can go around.
We need to plan sequence. Let's analyze grid connectivity. We have positions 0-5 rows and columns. Robot starts at pos0-3. We need to get key0 to pos3-5. Key0 currently at pos3-1. So we need to move robot to pos3-1, pick up key0, move to pos3-5, put down. But must avoid pos2-1. Also need to move key2 from pos2-4 to pos1-1. Key2 currently at pos2-4. So we need to get robot to pos2-4, pick up key2, move to pos1-1, put down. But we also need to ensure key0 ends at pos3-5. So we need to plan order.
We must also consider that key1 is irrelevant to goal. But we might need to move it? Not necessary.
We need to ensure robot never at pos2-1. So we must avoid that location. Let's examine connectivity: pos2-1 is connected to pos3-1, pos2-2, pos1-1, pos2-0. So robot could go through but must avoid. So we can plan path that doesn't go through pos2-1.
We need to move key0 from pos3-1 to pos3-5. Path: from pos3-1 to pos3-5. We can go via pos3-2, pos3-3, pos3-4, pos3-5. All open. So robot can go from pos0-3 to pos3-1 via path: pos0-3 -> pos
