analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: grid with actions: unlock, move, pickup, pickup-and-loose, putdown.
Predicates: conn, key-shape, lock-shape, at, at-robot, place, key, shape, locked, holding, open, arm-empty.
Initial state: robot at pos4-1. Keys at positions: key0 at pos2-3, key1 at pos1-4, key2 at pos2-2. Locked positions: pos4-2, pos0-3, pos3-1. Open positions: many open except those locked. lock-shape: pos4-2 shape0, pos0-3 shape1, pos3-1 shape0. So locked positions have shapes.
Goal: at key1 pos4-3 and at key2 pos4-3. So we need to move key1 and key2 to pos4-3. They start at pos1-4 and pos2-2 respectively. We need to move them to pos4-3. The robot starts at pos4-1. We need to navigate to keys, pick them up, and deliver to pos4-3.
Constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-3)). So robot cannot be at pos3-3 at any time.
Also, we must consider locked positions: pos4-2 locked, pos0-3 locked, pos3-1 locked. So robot cannot enter those positions unless unlocked. But open positions include many others. The robot can move to open positions only. The robot cannot be at pos3-3 at any time.
We need to plan path to key1 at pos1-4. Let's examine connectivity.
Connections list: we have connections between positions. Let's map connectivity.
We have a 5x5 grid positions pos0-0 to pos4-4. Connections are given for each pair. Let's list adjacency:
pos0-0 connected to pos1-0, pos0-1.
pos0-1 connected to pos1-1, pos0-2, pos0-0.
pos0-2 connected to pos1-2, pos0-3, pos0-1.
pos0-3 connected to pos1-3, pos0-4, pos0-2.
pos0-4 connected to pos1-4, pos0-3.
pos1-0 connected to
