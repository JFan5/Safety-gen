analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that moves robot from pos3-2 to pos1-4, picking up key1 at pos4-4, then unlocking pos1-4? Wait goal: (at key1 pos1-4). So we need to move key1 to pos1-4. Key1 currently at pos4-4. Robot starts at pos3-2. We need to pick up key1, move to pos1-4, put down. But we must consider locked positions: pos1-4 is open? open pos1-4 is open. But pos1-4 is not locked. So we can just move robot to pos1-4 and put down key1. But we must ensure robot can reach pos1-4. Let's check connectivity: pos3-2 connected to pos4-2, pos3-3, pos2-2. pos4-2 connected to pos4-3, pos3-2, pos4-1. pos4-3 connected to pos4-4, pos3-3, pos4-2. pos4-4 connected to pos3-4, pos4-3. pos3-4 connected to pos4-4, pos3-3. pos3-3 connected to pos4-3, pos3-4, pos2-3. pos2-3 connected to pos3-3, pos2-4, pos1-3. pos2-4 connected to pos3-4, pos2-3, pos1-4. So path: pos3-2 -> pos4-2 -> pos4-3 -> pos4-4 -> pos3-4 -> pos2-4 -> pos1-4. But we need to ensure open status: all these positions are open. Yes open pos4-2, pos4-3, pos4-4, pos3-4, pos2-4, pos1-4 are open. So robot can move.
But we must also consider constraints: always (not (at-robot pos3-4)). So robot cannot be at pos3-4 at any time. So we cannot step onto pos3-4. So we need to avoid that. We can go around: maybe path: pos3-2 -> pos2-2 -> pos2-3 -> pos2-4 -> pos1-4. Let's check connectivity: pos3-2 connected to pos2-2. pos
