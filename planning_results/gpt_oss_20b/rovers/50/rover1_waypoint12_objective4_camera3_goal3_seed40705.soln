commentary# Plan Generation for Rover Domain
# Goal:
# 1. communicated_soil_data(waypoint3)
# 2. communicated_soil_data(waypoint2)
# 3. communicated_image_data(objective2,high_res)
# 4. communicated_image_data(objective1,high_res)
# 5. communicated_image_data(objective3,low_res)
# Constraints:
# - sometime-before (at(rover0,waypoint0)) (at(rover0,waypoint1))
#   => rover0 must reach waypoint1 AFTER it has visited waypoint0.
# Initial State:
# - rover0 at waypoint3
# - store rover0store full rover0, empty rover0store
# - equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0
# - equipped_for_imaging rover0
# - on_board camera0 rover0 (calibration_target camera0 objective3)
#   supports camera0 high_res, low_res
# - on_board camera1 rover0 (calibration_target camera1 objective0)
#   supports camera1 high_res
# - on_board camera2 rover0 (calibration_target camera2 objective0)
#   supports camera2 colour, high_res, low_res
# - soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint3
# - rock samples at waypoint2,5,7,8
# - lander general at waypoint11, channel_free general
# - visibility and can_traverse links as listed
# - calibration targets:
#     camera0 -> objective3
#     camera1 -> objective0
#     camera2 -> objective0
# - objective visibility:
#     objective0 visible_from waypoint6,7,8
#     objective1 visible_from waypoint0,1,2,4,6,7,8
#     objective2 visible_from waypoint6,7
#     objective3 visible_from waypoint0,1,4,9,11
# - objectives:
#     objective0,1,2,3 (no other properties)
# - modes:
#     general, high_res, low_res, colour
# Constraints check:
# - The constraint requires that at(rover0,waypoint0) occurs sometime before at(rover0,waypoint1).
#   Since the initial state has rover0 at waypoint3, we must plan a route that visits waypoint0 and then waypoint1.
#   This route must be incorporated before any other actions that could interfere with the constraint.
