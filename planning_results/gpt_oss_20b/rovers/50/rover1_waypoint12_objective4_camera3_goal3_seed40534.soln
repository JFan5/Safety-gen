analysisWe need to produce a plan for the rover domain. The problem includes constraints: (:constraints (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6))). So rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint6. Also goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_rock_data waypoint11, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 colour.
We must also satisfy all constraints: The PDDL3 constraints include the one in (:constraints). Also there might be implicit constraints: all goals must be achieved; all constraints must hold; all invariants (like types, predicates like store_of, on_board, etc.) must hold. Also we must not violate any domain constraints: e.g., cannot navigate to a waypoint if not can_traverse; cannot sample if not equipped; cannot calibrate if not at waypoint and visible_from target and on_board; take_image uses calibrated camera and supports mode, visible_from objective, at waypoint; communicate_soil_data requires have_soil_analysis and channel_free and available; communicate_rock_data requires have_rock_analysis; communicate_image_data requires have_image.
Also we must manage store: rover0store is store_of rover0. It starts empty. sample_soil and sample_rock require store_of and empty. They produce full store and have data. drop empties store. So we need to sample rock at waypoint7 and waypoint11, then communicate them to lander at waypoint2. Lander general at waypoint2. So we need to go to waypoint7, sample rock, then go to waypoint2, communicate_rock_data. Then go to waypoint11, sample rock, go to waypoint2, communicate_rock_data. Also we need to calibrate camera0 to objective0, then take_image high_res at waypoint0? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint0,1,2,8,11. For high_res, camera0 supports high_res. So we need to be rover0 at a waypoint where objective0 visible_from, and camera0 on_board, calibrated to rover0, and supports high_res. Then take_image. After take_image, calibrated status of camera0 is lost (not calibrated). So we need to calibrate again before next image. For objective3 colour, visible_from waypoint0,1,2,3,5,6,8. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective3 visible_from, camera2 supports colour, and calibrated. camera2 supports colour and high_res. So we
