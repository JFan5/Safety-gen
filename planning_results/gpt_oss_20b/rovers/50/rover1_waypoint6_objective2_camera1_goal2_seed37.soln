commentaryWe need to generate a plan for roverprob37. Domain is rover with actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data. Problem includes constraints: (:constraints (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0))). So rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint0. That's the only constraint. Goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint2 and communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. So we need to collect soil sample at waypoint2, communicate it to lander at waypoint3, and take low_res image of objective0 and communicate it to lander as well. Objective0 is visible_from waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5. So we can take image at waypoint5 (since rover starts there) or waypoint2 or waypoint0 or waypoint3. But we need low_res mode. Camera0 supports low_res and colour. Also supports? It supports low_res and colour. So low_res is fine. Also need to calibrate camera before take_image. Calibration target is objective0. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective0 is visible_from and camera0 is on board. Also need to be calibrated for objective0. Calibration action: calibrate rover camera objective waypoint. Preconditions: equipped_for_imaging rover, calibration_target camera objective, at rover waypoint, visible_from objective waypoint, on_board camera rover. Effect: calibrated camera rover. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective0 is visible_from. Those are waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5. Also we need to take_image with mode low_res. Precondition: calibrated camera rover, on_board camera rover, equipped_for_imaging rover, supports camera mode, visible_from objective waypoint, at rover waypoint. So we need to be at one of those waypoints, calibrated for objective0, and then take_image with low_res. After take_image, the effect removes calibrated camera rover. So we need to calibrate again before another take_image. But we only need one image, so calibrate once, take_image, then communicate_image_data. Communicate_image_data preconditions: at rover waypoint, at_lander lander waypoint, have_image rover objective mode, visible waypoint_lander, available rover, channel_free lander. Effect: removes available rover, removes channel_free lander, adds communicated_image_data objective mode, and restores available rover and channel_free land
