analysisWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint:
(:constraints
(sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint8))
)
Goal requires communicated_soil_data at waypoint11, waypoint0, waypoint4, and communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res.
We have initial data: at_soil_sample waypoint0, at_rock_sample waypoint2, at_soil_sample waypoint4, at_rock_sample waypoint5, at_rock_sample waypoint6, at_rock_sample waypoint9, at_soil_sample waypoint10, at_soil_sample waypoint11, at_rock_sample waypoint11. Lander general at waypoint5, channel_free general. Rover0 at waypoint1, equipped for soil analysis, imaging, on board cameras0,1,2 with calibration targets objective3, objective2, supports low_res for camera0, colour for camera1, colour and high_res for camera2. store_of rover0store rover0, empty rover0store.
We need to communicate soil data from waypoint11, waypoint0, waypoint4. Also image data from objective3 colour, objective1 low_res.
Constraints: rover0 must be at waypoint1 before it is at waypoint8 (sometime-before). So we must ensure that at some point before the first time rover0 reaches waypoint8, it was at waypoint1. That is satisfied if we start at waypoint1 and later go to waypoint8. So we just need to ensure we don't go to waypoint8 before visiting waypoint1. Since we start at waypoint1, that's fine.
We must also satisfy all invariants: e.g., cannot sample_soil if not at_soil_sample, cannot sample_rock if not at_rock_sample, cannot sample if store full, etc. Also calibrate requires calibrated target: (calibration_target ?i ?t) and (visible_from ?t ?w) and (at ?r ?w) and (on_board ?i ?r). So to calibrate camera0 for objective3, we need to be at a waypoint where objective3 is visible. visible_from objective3 waypoint10 and waypoint11. So we need to be at waypoint10 or waypoint11 to calibrate camera0. Also supports low_res for camera0. So take_image with objective3, low_res? Wait we need objective3 colour. camera0 supports low_res only. So we cannot take objective3 colour with camera0
