commentary# Let's check the domain:
# - actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image,
#   communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data
# - requirements: :strips :typing :constraints
# So constraints are allowed.
# PROBLEM includes:
# (:goal ...) with 10 subgoals:
#   communicated_soil_data waypoint2
#   communicated_soil_data waypoint8
#   communicated_soil_data waypoint4
#   communicated_rock_data waypoint0
#   communicated_rock_data waypoint1
#   communicated_rock_data waypoint11
#   communicated_rock_data waypoint9
#   communicated_image_data objective3 high_res
#   communicated_image_data objective1 low_res
# (:constraints ...) includes:
#   (and
#     (always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover1 waypoint0))))
#     (always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint11) (at rover1 waypoint11))))
#   )
# So rover0 and rover1 cannot be at waypoint0 or waypoint11 simultaneously at any time.
# INITIAL STATE facts:
# Visibility between waypoints (list of (visible wpX wpY)):
# waypoint0 <-> waypoint3, waypoint0<->waypoint4, waypoint0<->waypoint5,
# waypoint0<->waypoint10, waypoint0<->waypoint7, waypoint0<->waypoint2,
# waypoint1<->waypoint4, waypoint1<->waypoint7, waypoint1<->waypoint10,
# waypoint1<->waypoint8, waypoint2<->waypoint0, waypoint2<->waypoint6,
# waypoint2<->waypoint9, waypoint2<->waypoint10, waypoint2<->waypoint11,
# waypoint3<->waypoint0, waypoint3<->waypoint2, waypoint3<->waypoint6,
# waypoint3<->waypoint9, waypoint3<->waypoint11,
# waypoint4<->waypoint1, waypoint4<->waypoint7, waypoint4<->waypoint5,
# waypoint4<->waypoint8, waypoint4<->waypoint0, waypoint4<->waypoint10,
# waypoint4<->waypoint5, waypoint5<->waypoint0, waypoint5<->waypoint2,
# waypoint5<->waypoint4
