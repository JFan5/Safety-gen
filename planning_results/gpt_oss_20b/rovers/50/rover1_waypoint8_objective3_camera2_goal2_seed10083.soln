commentary# Let's parse the domain and problem.
# We'll need:
# - types
# - predicates (with arity and arguments types)
# - actions:
#   name
#   parameters (list of (var, type))
#   precondition (formula)
#   effect (formula)
#   requirements (like :strips, :typing, :constraints)
# Problem:
# - objects (name - type)
# - initial state (set of ground predicate instances)
# - goal (formula)
# - constraints (PDDL3 constraints)
# Let's extract the relevant parts manually:
# DOMAIN:
# (:types rover waypoint store camera mode lander objective)
# (:predicates
#    (at ?x - rover ?y - waypoint)
