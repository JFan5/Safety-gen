analysisWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain. Let's restate the problem:
Domain rover with actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
Objects:
- Lander: general
- Modes: general - Lander, colour high_res low_res - Mode
- Rovers: rover0 rover1 - Rover
- Stores: rover0store rover1store - Store
- Waypoints: waypoint0 waypoint1 waypoint2 waypoint3 waypoint4 waypoint5 waypoint6 waypoint7 waypoint8 waypoint9 waypoint10 waypoint11 - Waypoint
- Cameras: camera0 camera1 camera2 camera3 - Camera
- Objectives: objective0 objective1 objective2 objective3 - Objective
Initial state:
Visibility between waypoints (visible X Y). Provided list.
Also can_traverse between waypoints for each rover separately.
Initial samples:
- at_soil_sample waypoint0
- at_rock_sample waypoint0
- at_soil_sample waypoint1
- at_sool_sample waypoint2
- at_rock_sample waypoint2
- at_soil_sample waypoint3
- at_soil_sample waypoint4
- at_rock_sample waypoint6
- at_soil_sample waypoint7
- at_rock_sample waypoint7
- at_soil_sample waypoint9
- at_rock_sample waypoint9
- at_rock_sample waypoint10
- at_soil_sample waypoint11
- at_rock_sample waypoint11
Lander:
- at_lander general waypoint2
- channel_free general
Rovers:
- at rover0 waypoint2
- available rover0
- store_of rover0store rover0
- empty rover0store
- equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0
- equipped_for_rock_analysis rover0
- equipped_for_imaging rover0
- at rover1 waypoint11
- available rover1
- store_of rover1store rover1
- empty rover1store
- equipped_for_rock_analysis rover1
- equipped_for_imaging rover1
