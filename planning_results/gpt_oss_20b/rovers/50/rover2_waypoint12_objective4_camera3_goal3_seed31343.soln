commentaryWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain with constraints. Let's analyze the domain, problem, and constraints.
Domain Rover:
Types: rover, waypoint, store, lander, objective, camera, mode, lander.
Predicates:
- at ?x - rover ?y - waypoint
- at_lander ?x - lander ?y - waypoint
- can_traverse ?r - rover ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint
- equipped_for_soil_analysis ?r - rover
- equipped_for_rock_analysis ?r - rover
- equipped_for_imaging ?r - rover
- empty ?s - store
- have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint
- have_soil_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint
- full ?s - store
- calibrated ?c - camera ?r - rover
- supports ?c - camera ?m - mode
- available ?r - rover
- visible ?w - waypoint ?p - waypoint
- have_image ?r - rover ?o - objective ?m - mode
- communicated_soil_data ?w - waypoint
- communicated_rock_data ?w - waypoint
- communicated_image_data ?o - objective ?m - mode
- at_soil_sample ?w - waypoint
- at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint
- visible_from ?o - objective ?w - waypoint
- store_of ?s - store ?r - rover
- calibration_target ?i - camera ?o - objective
- visible_from ?o - objective ?w - waypoint
- on_board ?i - camera ?r - rover
- channel_free ?l - lander
Actions:
1. navigate
:parameters (?x - rover ?y - waypoint ?z - waypoint)
:precondition (and (can_traverse ?x ?y ?z) (available ?x) (at ?x ?y)
(visible ?y ?z))
:effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at ?x ?z)))
2. sample_soil
:parameters (?x - rover ?s - store ?p - waypoint)
:precondition (and (at ?x ?p) (at_soil_sample ?p)
(equipped_for_soil_analysis ?x) (store_of ?s ?x) (empty ?s))
:effect (and (not (empty ?s)) (full ?s) (have_soil
