analysisWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint: (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint9) (at rover0 waypoint2)). That means at some point in the plan, rover0 must be at waypoint9, and at some (possibly later) point, rover0 must be at waypoint2, with the constraint that the time when at waypoint9 must be before the time when at waypoint2. So the rover must visit waypoint9 before waypoint2. Also, the goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint5, waypoint11, waypoint1; communicated_rock_data waypoint1, waypoint3, waypoint0; communicated_image_data objective1 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 colour.
We must also satisfy all constraints and invariants. Let's list domain facts:
Predicates:
- at ?x - rover ?y - waypoint
- at_lander ?x - lander ?y - waypoint
- can_traverse ?r - rover ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint
- equipped_for_soil_analysis ?r - rover
- equipped_for_rock_analysis ?r - rover
- empty ?s - store
- full ?s - store
- store_of ?s - store ?r - rover
- at_soil_sample ?w - waypoint
- at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint
- have_soil_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint
- have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint
- calibrated ?c - camera ?r - rover
- calibration_target ?i - camera ?o - objective
- supports ?i - camera ?m - mode
- available ?r - rover
- visible ?w - waypoint ?p - waypoint
- visible_from ?o - objective ?w - waypoint
- on_board ?i - camera ?r - rover
- channel_free ?l - lander
- have_image ?r - rover ?o - objective ?m - mode
- communicated_soil_data ?w - waypoint
- communicated_rock_data ?w - waypoint
- communicated_image_data ?o - objective ?m - mode
Actions:
navigate: params (?x - rover ?y - waypoint ?z - waypoint)
pre: (can_traverse ?x ?y ?z) (available ?x) (at ?x ?y) (visible ?y ?z)
effect: (not (at ?x ?y)) (at ?x ?
