analysisWe need to produce a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint: (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6)). So waypoint1 must be visited before waypoint6. Also the goal requires communicated_rock_data for waypoint2 and waypoint10, and communicated_image_data for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res.
We must also satisfy all constraints: The rover must be at waypoint2 initially. It must navigate to collect rock samples at waypoint2 and waypoint10, then communicate them to the lander at waypoint7. Also take images for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res, then communicate those images to the lander.
We must calibrate cameras before taking images. Calibration targets: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So camera0 and camera1 are calibrated for objective1; camera2 for objective2. None for objective0 or objective3. But take_image action requires calibrated <camera> <rover> and supports <camera> <mode>, and visible_from <objective> <waypoint>, and at <rover> <waypoint>. So to take image for objective0 high_res, we need a camera that is calibrated for objective0 and supports high_res. But no camera is calibrated for objective0. Similarly for objective3 low_res: need camera calibrated for objective3 and supports low_res. None. So the goal is unreachable? Wait, maybe cameras can be calibrated for any objective? But calibration_target defines which objective a camera can be calibrated for. In init: (calibration_target camera0 objective1), (calibration_target camera1 objective1), (calibration_target camera2 objective2). So only objective1 can calibrate camera0 and camera1; objective2 can calibrate camera2. So objective0 and objective3 cannot calibrate any camera. Thus take_image for objective0 or objective3 cannot be done because no camera can be calibrated for them. So the goal is impossible. But maybe the domain allows calibration for any objective? No, calibrate action requires (calibration_target ?i ?t) and (visible_from ?t ?w). So t must be objective0 or objective3? But calibration_target only defined for objective1 and objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective0 or objective3. So take_image for those objectives impossible. Thus goal unreachable. Therefore the correct output is "No solution" or something? But the instructions: "
