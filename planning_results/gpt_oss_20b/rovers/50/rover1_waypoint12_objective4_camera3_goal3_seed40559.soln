analysisWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes PDDL3 constraints: (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint7)). So rover0 must reach waypoint1 before waypoint7. Also, goal requires communicated_soil_data for waypoint2, waypoint9, waypoint6, waypoint4, and communicated_image_data for objective1 low_res and objective0 low_res.
We must also satisfy all other constraints: domain constraints: e.g., (equipped_for_soil_analysis ?x - rover) must hold for sample_soil; (equipped_for_rock_analysis ?x - rover) for sample_rock; (empty ?s - store) for drop; (calibrated ?c - camera ?r - rover) for take_image; (supports ?c - camera ?m - mode) for take_image; (calibration_target ?i - camera ?o - objective) for calibrate; (visible_from ?o - objective ?w - waypoint) for calibrate and take_image; (on_board ?i - camera ?r - rover) for calibrate and take_image; (equipped_for_imaging ?r - rover) for calibrate and take_image; (channel_free ?l - lander) for communicate actions; (available ?r - rover) for navigate, sample, communicate; (store_of ?s - store ?r - rover) for sample and drop; (full ?s - store) for sample and drop; (have_soil_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint) for communicate_soil_data; (have_rock_analysis ?r - rover ?w - waypoint) for communicate_rock_data; (have_image ?r - rover ?o - objective ?m - mode) for communicate_image_data; (at_lander ?l - lander ?y - waypoint) for communicate; (at ?x - rover ?y - waypoint) for navigate, calibrate, take_image, communicate; (visible ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint) for navigate; (visible_from ?o - objective ?w - waypoint) for calibrate and take_image; (at_soil_sample ?w - waypoint) for sample_soil; (at_rock_sample ?w - waypoint) for sample_rock.
Also domain constraints: (equipped_for_soil_analysis ?x - rover) must hold; (equipped_for_rock_analysis ?x - rover) must hold; (equipped_for
