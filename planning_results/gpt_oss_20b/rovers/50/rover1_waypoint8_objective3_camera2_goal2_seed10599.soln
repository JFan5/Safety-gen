commentaryWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint: (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint2)). So rover0 must visit waypoint5 before it visits waypoint2. Also goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_soil_data waypoint4, and communicated_image_data objective0 colour.
We have soil samples at waypoint1, waypoint4, waypoint5, waypoint7. Rock samples at waypoint3, waypoint6. waypoint2 has no sample. waypoint0 has no sample. So to get communicated_soil_data for waypoint5 and waypoint4, rover must sample soil at those waypoints and then communicate the data to the lander at waypoint0. The lander is at waypoint0. Communication requires: rover at waypoint x, lander at waypoint y, have_soil_analysis at waypoint p, visible waypoint x waypoint y, rover available, lander channel_free. After communicate_soil_data, (available rover) becomes false, (channel_free lander) becomes false, but then effect includes (channel_free lander) and (available rover) again, so they are restored. So communication is fine.
Also goal requires communicated_image_data objective0 colour. So rover must take an image with camera supporting colour mode, objective0 visible_from waypoint? The visible_from facts: objective0 visible_from waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4. So to take image of objective0, rover must be at one of those waypoints, camera must be calibrated, supports colour, and visible_from objective0 waypoint. Also need (calibrated camera0 rover0) precondition for take_image. Calibration action: parameters (?r - rover ?i - camera ?t - objective ?w - waypoint). Precondition: (equipped_for_imaging ?r) (calibration_target ?i ?t) (at ?r ?w) (visible_from ?t ?w) (on_board ?i ?r). Effect: calibrated ?i ?r. So to calibrate camera0, we need calibration_target camera0 objective2, and rover at waypoint where objective2 visible_from. visible_from facts: objective2 visible_from waypoint4. So rover must go to waypoint4 to calibrate camera0. After calibration, take_image requires (calibrated camera0 rover0) (on_board camera0 rover0) (equipped_for_imaging rover0) (supports camera0 ?m) (visible_from objective
