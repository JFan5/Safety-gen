Problem includes constraints: (:constraints (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0))). So rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint0. That's the only constraint. Goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint2 and communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. So we need to collect soil sample at waypoint2, communicate it to lander at waypoint3, and take low_res image of objective0 and communicate it to lander as well. Objective0 is visible_from waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5. So we can take image at waypoint5 (since rover starts there) or waypoint2 or waypoint0 or waypoint3. But we need low_res mode. Camera0 supports low_res and colour. Also supports? It supports low_res and colour. So low_res is fine. Also need to calibrate camera before take_image. Calibration target is objective0. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective0 is visible_from and camera0 is on board. Also need to be calibrated for objective0. Calibration action: calibrate rover camera objective waypoint. Preconditions: equipped_for_imaging rover, calibration_target camera objective, at rover waypoint, visible_from objective waypoint, on_board camera rover. Effect: calibrated camera rover. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective0 is visible_from. Those are waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5. Also we need to take_image with mode low_res. Precondition: calibrated camera rover, on_board camera rover, equipped_for_imaging rover, supports camera mode, visible_from objective waypoint, at rover waypoint. So we need to be at one of those waypoints, calibrated for objective0, and then take_image with low_res. After take_image, the effect removes calibrated camera rover. So we need to calibrate again before another take_image. But we only need one image, so calibrate once, take_image, then communicate_image_data. Communicate_image_data preconditions: at rover waypoint, at_lander lander waypoint, have_image rover objective mode, visible waypoint_lander, available rover, channel_free lander. Effect: removes available rover, removes channel_free lander, adds communicated_image_data objective mode, and restores available rover and channel_free land",

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to generate a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint:\n(:constraints\n(sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint8))\n)\nGoal requires communicated_soil_data at waypoint11, waypoint0, waypoint4, and communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res.\nWe have initial data: at_soil_sample waypoint0, at_rock_sample waypoint2, at_soil_sample waypoint4, at_rock_sample waypoint5, at_rock_sample waypoint6, at_rock_sample waypoint9, at_soil_sample waypoint10, at_soil_sample waypoint11, at_rock_sample waypoint11. Lander general at waypoint5, channel_free general. Rover0 at waypoint1, equipped for soil analysis, imaging, on board cameras0,1,2 with calibration targets objective3, objective2, supports low_res for camera0, colour for camera1, colour and high_res for camera2. store_of rover0store rover0, empty rover0store.\nWe need to communicate soil data from waypoint11, waypoint0, waypoint4. Also image data from objective3 colour, objective1 low_res.\nConstraints: rover0 must be at waypoint1 before it is at waypoint8 (sometime-before). So we must ensure that at some point before the first time rover0 reaches waypoint8, it was at waypoint1. That is satisfied if we start at waypoint1 and later go to waypoint8. So we just need to ensure we don't go to waypoint8 before visiting waypoint1. Since we start at waypoint1, that's fine.\nWe must also satisfy all invariants: e.g., cannot sample_soil if not at_soil_sample, cannot sample_rock if not at_rock_sample, cannot sample if store full, etc. Also calibrate requires calibrated target: (calibration_target ?i ?t) and (visible_from ?t ?w) and (at ?r ?w) and (on_board ?i ?r). So to calibrate camera0 for objective3, we need to be at a waypoint where objective3 is visible. visible_from objective3 waypoint10 and waypoint11. So we need to be at waypoint10 or waypoint11 to calibrate camera0. Also supports low_res for camera0. So take_image with objective3, low_res? Wait we need objective3 colour. camera0 supports low_res only. So we cannot take objective3 colour with camera0",

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a plan for the rover domain. The problem includes constraints: (:constraints (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6))). So rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint6. Also goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_rock_data waypoint11, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 colour.\nWe must also satisfy all constraints: The PDDL3 constraints include the one in (:constraints). Also there might be implicit constraints: all goals must be achieved; all constraints must hold; all invariants (like types, predicates like store_of, on_board, etc.) must hold. Also we must not violate any domain constraints: e.g., cannot navigate to a waypoint if not can_traverse; cannot sample if not equipped; cannot calibrate if not at waypoint and visible_from target and on_board; take_image uses calibrated camera and supports mode, visible_from objective, at waypoint; communicate_soil_data requires have_soil_analysis and channel_free and available; communicate_rock_data requires have_rock_analysis; communicate_image_data requires have_image.\nAlso we must manage store: rover0store is store_of rover0. It starts empty. sample_soil and sample_rock require store_of and empty. They produce full store and have data. drop empties store. So we need to sample rock at waypoint7 and waypoint11, then communicate them to lander at waypoint2. Lander general at waypoint2. So we need to go to waypoint7, sample rock, then go to waypoint2, communicate_rock_data. Then go to waypoint11, sample rock, go to waypoint2, communicate_rock_data. Also we need to calibrate camera0 to objective0, then take_image high_res at waypoint0? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint0,1,2,8,11. For high_res, camera0 supports high_res. So we need to be rover0 at a waypoint where objective0 visible_from, and camera0 on_board, calibrated to rover0, and supports high_res. Then take_image. After take_image, calibrated status of camera0 is lost (not calibrated). So we need to calibrate again before next image. For objective3 colour, visible_from waypoint0,1,2,3,5,6,8. So we need to be at a waypoint where objective3 visible_from, camera2 supports colour, and calibrated. camera2 supports colour and high_res. So we",

After calibration, the camera is calibrated for that waypoint. Calibration is lost when the rover takes an image.\n- **Image Taking**: `take_image` requires the camera to be calibrated, the rover to be at a waypoint, the objective to be visible from that waypoint, and the camera mode to be supported. After taking an image, the camera becomes uncalibrated.\n- **Communication**: Rover can communicate soil, rock, or image data to a lander if:\n- Rover and lander are both available.\n- Rover is at a waypoint visible to the lander’s waypoint.\n- The relevant data (soil at waypoint, rock at waypoint, image from objective+mode) has been collected.\nCommunication actions make the rover and lander unavailable, but immediately free them again, thus preserving availability for subsequent communications.\n- **Constraints**:\n- `sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint2)`\nRover0 must visit waypoint2 at some point after having been at waypoint4.\n## Initial State Summary\n- Rover0 starts at **waypoint4** (which is also the lander’s location).\n- Stores: `rover0store` is empty.\n- Waypoint facts:\n- Soil samples at waypoint2, waypoint4, waypoint5.\n- Rock sample at waypoint3.\n- Objectives visible:\n- `objective0` from waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint5.\n- `objective1` from waypoint0, waypoint4.\n- Camera0 is on Rover0 and can take high_res and low_res images.\n- Calibration target for camera0 is `objective1`.\n- All instruments for soil, rock, and imaging are equipped.\n- Visibility and traversal graphs are fully symmetric as listed.\n## Goal Requirements\n1. **Communicated Data**:\n-",

Domain Rover with constraints: always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint10) (at rover1 waypoint10))) etc. So they cannot be simultaneously at waypoint10, waypoint9, waypoint11. Also they cannot be at waypoint10 simultaneously. Also waypoint9 and waypoint11 constraints. So we must ensure plan respects that.\nGoal: communicated_soil_data waypoint9, waypoint7, waypoint11, waypoint2. communicated_rock_data waypoint10, waypoint9, waypoint11. communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res.\nSo we need to collect soil samples from waypoint9, waypoint7, waypoint11, waypoint2. Also rock samples from waypoint10, waypoint9, waypoint11. Also take images: objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res.\nWe have initial samples: waypoint0 rock, waypoint1 rock, waypoint2 soil, waypoint3 rock, waypoint4 soil, waypoint5 rock, waypoint7 soil, waypoint8 rock, waypoint9 soil, waypoint9 rock, waypoint10 soil, waypoint10 rock, waypoint11 soil, waypoint11 rock. So waypoint9 has both soil and rock, waypoint7 soil, waypoint11 soil and rock, waypoint2 soil. Good.\nRover0 starts at waypoint8, equipped for soil only. Rover1 starts at waypoint10, equipped for soil, rock, imaging. Stores: rover0store, rover1store. They have store_of. Rover0store empty, rover1store empty. They can sample soil/rock into store if empty. They can drop to empty store. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint1. Lander at waypoint1, channel_free.\nAlso calibrate action: needs rover, camera, target objective, waypoint where both rover and target are, and target must be calibration_target for camera. On_board camera0, camera1, camera2 all at rover1. Calibration_target: camera0 objective3, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So camera2 objective2, camera0 objective3. So to calibrate for objective3 we use camera0; for objective2 use camera2. Mode must be supported: camera0 supports high_res, low_res. camera2 supports colour, high_res. So for objective3 low_res we can use camera0 low_res. For objective2 high_res we can use camera2 high_res.

So rover0 must reach waypoint6 before waypoint4. Also goal: communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, objective0 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 high_res. So need images with those objective-mode combos.\nWe have cameras: camera0 calibration_target objective0 supports high_res, low_res. camera1 calibration_target objective2 supports high_res, low_res. camera2 calibration_target objective1 supports colour, high_res.\nSo to get objective0 colour, we need camera2 (supports colour) but calibration_target is objective1, so camera2 cannot be calibrated for objective0. Only camera0 can be calibrated for objective0, but supports only high_res, low_res. So objective0 colour impossible? Wait maybe objective0 visible_from includes waypoint1? Let's check visible_from: objective0 waypoint2,4,6,8. No waypoint1. So objective0 cannot be seen from waypoint1. So objective0 colour cannot be achieved with current cameras. But maybe objective0 colour could be taken from a different waypoint? But visible_from defines visibility; camera must be on rover, calibrated for objective, supports mode. So objective0 colour requires camera2 (supports colour) calibrated for objective0 (calibration_target defines which objective a camera can be calibrated for). camera2 calibration_target objective1, so cannot be calibrated for objective0. So impossible. So the problem is unsolvable. But we must output a plan that satisfies constraints. Since it's unsolvable, maybe we should output nothing? But instructions say return only plan steps. If unsolvable, no plan exists. In such case, typical outputs are \"No solution\" or \"unsolvable\". But instruction didn't specify. It said \"If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.\" It didn't say what to do if unsolvable. So we must produce a plan that satisfies goal and constraints. Since it's impossible, we cannot produce such plan. But maybe we misread: camera0 supports high_res, low_res. camera1 supports high_res, low_res. camera2 supports colour, high_res. So objective0 colour impossible. So goal unsatisfiable. So the correct response is that no plan exists. But instruction didn't allow that. However, it's",

After last sample, we could drop but not necessary if we don't need store empty.

      "raw_solution": "analysisWe need to produce a plan for the rover domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint: (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6)). So waypoint1 must be visited before waypoint6. Also the goal requires communicated_rock_data for waypoint2 and waypoint10, and communicated_image_data for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res.\nWe must also satisfy all constraints: The rover must be at waypoint2 initially. It must navigate to collect rock samples at waypoint2 and waypoint10, then communicate them to the lander at waypoint7. Also take images for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res, then communicate those images to the lander.\nWe must calibrate cameras before taking images. Calibration targets: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So camera0 and camera1 are calibrated for objective1; camera2 for objective2. None for objective0 or objective3. But take_image action requires calibrated <camera> <rover> and supports <camera> <mode>, and visible_from <objective> <waypoint>, and at <rover> <waypoint>. So to take image for objective0 high_res, we need a camera that is calibrated for objective0 and supports high_res. But no camera is calibrated for objective0. Similarly for objective3 low_res: need camera calibrated for objective3 and supports low_res. None. So the goal is unreachable? Wait, maybe cameras can be calibrated for any objective? But calibration_target defines which objective a camera can be calibrated for. In init: (calibration_target camera0 objective1), (calibration_target camera1 objective1), (calibration_target camera2 objective2). So only objective1 can calibrate camera0 and camera1; objective2 can calibrate camera2. So objective0 and objective3 cannot calibrate any camera. Thus take_image for objective0 or objective3 cannot be done because no camera can be calibrated for them. So the goal is impossible. But maybe the domain allows calibration for any objective? No, calibrate action requires (calibration_target ?i ?t) and (visible_from ?t ?w). So t must be objective0 or objective3? But calibration_target only defined for objective1 and objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective0 or objective3. So take_image for those objectives impossible. Thus goal unreachable. Therefore the correct output is \"No solution\" or something?

So to get communicated_soil_data for waypoint5 and waypoint4, rover must sample soil at those waypoints and then communicate the data to the lander at waypoint0. The lander is at waypoint0. Communication requires: rover at waypoint x, lander at waypoint y, have_soil_analysis at waypoint p, visible waypoint x waypoint y, rover available, lander channel_free. After communicate_soil_data, (available rover) becomes false, (channel_free lander) becomes false, but then effect includes (channel_free lander) and (available rover) again, so they are restored. So communication is fine.\nAlso goal requires communicated_image_data objective0 colour. So rover must take an image with camera supporting colour mode, objective0 visible_from waypoint? The visible_from facts: objective0 visible_from waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4.
