commentary# Plan Generation for Rover Domain
# ---------------------------------
# The task is to satisfy the PDDL3 goal:
#   - (communicated_image_data objective2 high_res)
# Constraints:
#   - (sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint3))
#   - All standard domain constraints (e.g., store capacities, calibration requirements, communication channel usage, etc.) must hold.
#
# Key facts:
#   - rover0 starts at waypoint0.
#   - waypoint0 has a soil sample and a rock sample.
#   - waypoint1 has a soil sample.
#   - waypoint2 has a rock sample.
#   - waypoint3 has a soil sample and a rock sample.
#   - waypoint4 has a rock sample.
#   - waypoint5 has a rock sample.
#   - waypoint7 has a rock sample.
#   - general (lander) is at waypoint4.
#   - store rover0store is empty and belongs to rover0.
#   - cameras:
#       * camera0 on rover0, calibration target objective0, supports colour mode.
#       * camera1 on rover0, calibration target objective2, supports high_res mode.
#   - visible_from:
#       * objective2 sees waypoint1, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5, waypoint7.
#       * high_res mode requires calibration with objective2 (camera1).
#   - visible:
#       * objective2 is a waypoint; visibility facts between waypoints are provided.
#   - visible_from objective0 includes waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5, waypoint6.
#   - visible_from objective1 includes waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint6.
#
# Constraints analysis:
#   1. The lander is at waypoint4; communication actions require the rover to be at a waypoint visible to the lander.
#      visible waypoint4 <-> waypoint0, waypoint1, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint5, waypoint6, waypoint7? Let's check:
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint0
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint1
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint2
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint3
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint5
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint6
#        - visible waypoint4 waypoint7
#      So waypoint4 sees all other waypoints. Thus communication can happen from any waypoint.
#
#   2. The lander must have a
