analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint4, communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_image_data objective2 colour, communicated_image_data objective1 colour. Also constraint: always (not (at rover1 waypoint5)). So rover1 must never be at waypoint5.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint2 initially, rover1 at waypoint8. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints with samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint0. Lander at waypoint0. They can communicate soil data from a rover at a waypoint to lander if visible and channel free. The goal requires communicated_soil_data at waypoint4 and waypoint2. So we need to have rover(s) at those waypoints, have soil analysis, then communicate.
Also need communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and objective1 colour. That requires have_image at those objectives with mode colour. The image data is communicated to lander general. So we need to take images at those objectives with camera that supports colour mode. Cameras: camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports high_res and low_res, camera2 supports colour. On board: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. So we can use camera0 or camera2 for colour.
We need to calibrate camera to objective. Calibration requires at waypoint, visible_from objective, on_board camera, calibration_target. For camera0, calibration_target is objective0. For camera2, calibration_target is objective0. So only objective0 is calibration target. But we need images for objective1 and objective2. Wait: The calibration_target predicate indicates which camera can calibrate which objective. For camera0 and camera2, target is objective0. So they cannot calibrate objective1 or objective2. But we can still take images? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera to objective. But if camera cannot calibrate objective1 or 2, we cannot take images for those objectives. But maybe we can use camera1? camera1 supports high_res and low_res, but its calibration_target? Not defined. So maybe camera1 cannot calibrate any objective. But the action calibrate requires calibration_target camera i t. So only camera0 and camera2 can calibrate objective0. So we cannot take images for objective1 or 2 with these cameras. But the goal requires communicated
