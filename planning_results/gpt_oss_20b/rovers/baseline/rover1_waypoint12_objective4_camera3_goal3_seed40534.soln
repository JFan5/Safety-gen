analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_rock_data waypoint11, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6). That means rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint6. Also must satisfy all preconditions.
We need to produce a sequence of actions. We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. It can traverse to many waypoints. We need to collect soil and rock samples at waypoints with samples. Then communicate data to lander general at waypoint2. The lander is at waypoint2. The rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander to communicate. The visible relations are given. We need to ensure that at the time of communication, the rover is at a waypoint visible to the lander (i.e., visible from the lander). The visible relations are symmetrical: visible waypointX waypointY. So we need to ensure that at the time of communication, the rover is at a waypoint that is visible to the lander at waypoint2. Let's check visible pairs: visible waypoint2 to waypoint6, visible waypoint6 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint4, visible waypoint4 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint7, visible waypoint7 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint10, visible waypoint10 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint11, visible waypoint11 to waypoint2. So the lander at waypoint2 can see waypoints 6,4,7,10,11. So the rover must be at one of those to communicate.
We need to communicate rock data for waypoint7 and waypoint11. So we need to have have_rock_analysis at those waypoints. That requires sample_rock action at those waypoints. The sample_rock action requires at rover at that waypoint, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of rover0store rover0, empty store. So we need to sample rock at waypoint7 and waypoint11. Then communicate rock data to lander.
Also need to communicate image data for objective0 high_res and objective3 colour. That requires have_image at those objectives with those modes. That requires calibrate camera, then take_image. The camera0 is calibration_target objective0, supports high_res. camera1 is calibration_target objective2 supports colour. camera2 is calibration_target objective1 supports colour
