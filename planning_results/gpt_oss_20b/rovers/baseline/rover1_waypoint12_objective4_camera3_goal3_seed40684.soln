analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint3,2,7,9 and communicated_image_data for objective1,2,3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover0 must visit waypoint4 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint0). So at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint4 before it is at waypoint0. So the plan must include that ordering.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We must consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint10. We have visible relations, can_traverse edges. We need to navigate to waypoints with samples to collect soil and rock data, then communicate to lander general at waypoint8. Also need to take images for objectives 1,2,3 low_res. We have cameras 0,1,2 with calibration targets: camera0 -> objective0, camera1 -> objective1, camera2 -> objective1. But we need images for objective1,2,3. We have camera0 supports colour, high_res, low_res. camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res. camera2 supports low_res only. So to get images for objective1,2,3 low_res, we can use camera0 or camera1 or camera2. But camera2 only supports low_res. So we can use camera0 or camera1 for low_res images for objective1,2,3. But camera0 calibration target is objective0, not objective1. So camera0 cannot take image for objective1? Wait calibration target indicates which objective the camera is calibrated for. For camera0, calibration_target camera0 objective0. So camera0 can only take images for objective0? But the take_image action requires calibrated camera i for rover r. So we need to calibrate camera for each objective. For objective1, we need camera1 or camera2. camera1 calibration target is objective1. Good. camera2 calibration target is objective1 too. So we can use camera1 to take image for objective1. For objective2 and objective3, we need camera0? But camera0 calibration target is objective0. So camera0 cannot take image for objective2 or 3. But camera1 supports low_res and is calibrated for objective1. camera2 supports low_res and is calibrated for objective1. So we
