analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint4, communicated_rock_data waypoint4, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must be at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint4? Wait "sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint4)" means that the state (at rover0 waypoint5) must occur before (at rover0 waypoint4). So the rover must visit waypoint5 before waypoint4. But the goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint4 and communicated_rock_data waypoint4, which require the rover to be at waypoint4 to communicate. So the rover must go to waypoint5 first, then to waypoint4. Also need to collect soil samples at waypoint3 and 4? Actually soil samples at waypoint2,3,4. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and 4. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints, then communicate. Also rock sample at waypoint4. So we need to sample rock at waypoint4. Also need to take image of objective1 high_res. The objective1 visible_from waypoint0,2,4. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective1. We can take image from any waypoint that can see objective1. We need to calibrate camera0 to objective1. The camera0 is on board. Calibration target camera0 objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that can see objective1. Then take image high_res. Then communicate image data.
We also need to ensure that the rover is at waypoint5 before waypoint4. So plan: start at waypoint4. We need to go to waypoint5 first. So we can navigate from waypoint4 to waypoint5. Then from waypoint5 to waypoint4. But we also need to sample soil at waypoint3 and 4. We can sample soil at waypoint3 while at waypoint3. But we need to be at waypoint3. We can navigate from waypoint4 to waypoint3? Wait we start at waypoint4. We can navigate to waypoint3? There is can_traverse from waypoint4 to waypoint3? Yes, can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3. So we can navigate to waypoint3. But we need to go to waypoint5 first before waypoint4. So we need to go to waypoint5, then back to
