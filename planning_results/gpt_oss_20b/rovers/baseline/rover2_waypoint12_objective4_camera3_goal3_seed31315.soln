analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res, objective0 high_res, objective1 colour. So we need to take images of these objectives with appropriate modes and communicate them via lander general.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint6, rover1 at waypoint9. They have cameras: camera0 on rover1, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective3, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective2. They support modes: camera0 supports high_res, low_res; camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res; camera2 supports colour, low_res.
We need to capture images of objective3 with colour mode, objective1 with low_res and colour, objective0 with high_res. We need to communicate these images via lander general. The lander is at waypoint4. The visible relationships: visible_from objective0 includes waypoint0,2,5,7,10,11. visible_from objective1 includes waypoint3,6. visible_from objective2 includes waypoint0. visible_from objective3 includes waypoint1,3,6,8,9,10.
We need to have rovers at positions that can see the objectives. For each objective, we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from that objective. For objective3, visible_from includes waypoint1,3,6,8,9,10. For objective1, visible_from includes waypoint3,6. For objective0, visible_from includes waypoint0,2,5,7,10,11.
We also need to have cameras calibrated for the objective. Calibration requires that the rover is at a waypoint that is visible_from the objective and the camera is on board and calibration_target matches. The calibrate action: preconditions: equipped_for_imaging, calibration_target, at rover at waypoint, visible_from objective at that waypoint, on_board camera. So we need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. For camera0 and camera1, target is objective3. For camera2, target is objective2. But we don't need objective2 images. So we can ignore camera2.
We need to take images with camera1 (supports colour, high_res, low_res). For objective3, we need colour mode. camera1 supports colour. So we can calibrate camera1 for objective3, then take image with colour mode
