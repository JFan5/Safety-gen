analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint11, communicated_soil_data waypoint9, communicated_rock_data waypoint10, communicated_rock_data waypoint2, communicated_rock_data waypoint6, communicated_rock_data waypoint9, communicated_image_data objective0 low_res, communicated_image_data objective2 high_res.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They can traverse between waypoints. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They can sample soil/rock, drop, calibrate, take image, communicate data.
Goal: need to communicate soil data for waypoint11 and 9. Also rock data for 10,2,6,9. Also image data for objective0 low_res and objective2 high_res.
We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.
We must satisfy constraint: never both rovers at waypoint11 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that achieves all goals.
We need to consider initial state: at rover0 waypoint2, rover1 waypoint11. So rover1 starts at waypoint11. But we need to communicate soil data for waypoint11. That means rover1 must have soil analysis at waypoint11. But initial state: at waypoint11 there is at_soil_sample waypoint11 and at_rock_sample waypoint11. So rover1 can sample soil and rock at waypoint11. But we need to communicate soil data for waypoint11. So we need to sample soil at waypoint11, then communicate.
But we also need to communicate soil data for waypoint9. So we need to sample soil at waypoint9. But initial state: at_soil_sample waypoint9 and at_rock_sample waypoint9. So we need to sample soil at waypoint9.
Also rock data for waypoint10,2,6,9. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.
Also image data for objective0 low_res and objective2 high_res. We need to take images at those objectives with appropriate camera and mode.
We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold.
We need to produce a plan that uses available actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We need to consider that each rover has a store: rover0store, rover1store. They can store samples. They can drop to empty store.
We need to ensure that after sampling, we communicate
