analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint10, communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_rock_data waypoint0,6,7, communicated_image_data objective0 colour, objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 5 simultaneously.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data. We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint7 respectively. They have stores. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil/rock at waypoints where samples exist. They can drop to store. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint11. The lander is at waypoint11. The lander is channel_free initially. The goal requires communicated data at waypoint10,3,0,6,7, and images for objective0 and 3.
We need to produce plan steps. We must ensure that at each step, preconditions hold. We must also ensure that after each action, state updates accordingly.
We need to produce a plan that uses the actions defined. Let's analyze the initial state.
Initial state:
- visible relations: many pairs. We need to know which waypoints are visible to each other. For navigation, we need can_traverse edges for rover0 and rover1. For rover0: edges between 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10, 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10, 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5
