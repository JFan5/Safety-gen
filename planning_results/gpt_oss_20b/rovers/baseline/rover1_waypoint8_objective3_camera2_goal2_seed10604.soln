analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint1, communicated_image_data objective2 low_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint6? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint2 must happen before at rover0 waypoint6. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint2 before it is at waypoint6. The initial state: rover0 at waypoint2. So that constraint is satisfied already? Wait constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means the event of being at waypoint2 must occur before being at waypoint6. Since initial state is at waypoint2, that holds. But we must ensure that we don't visit waypoint6 before waypoint2. Since we start at waypoint2, we can go to other waypoints. But we must not visit waypoint6 before we visited waypoint2. Since we start at waypoint2, it's fine.
Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3 and waypoint1. That requires we have soil analysis at those waypoints and then communicate. We have soil samples at waypoint1, waypoint3, waypoint4, waypoint6. We need to sample soil at waypoint3 and waypoint1. We have at_soil_sample at waypoint1 and waypoint3. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. We also need to communicate soil data for those waypoints. We also need to communicate image data for objective2 low_res. That requires we have image data for objective2 low_res. We need to take image at objective2 with low_res mode. We have camera0 supports colour and low_res. camera0 calibration target objective2. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint visible from objective2. We have visible_from objective2 waypoint1,2,3,4,5,6. So we can calibrate at any of those waypoints. We need to be at a waypoint that is visible from objective2. We can calibrate at waypoint1 or 2 etc. Then take image at objective2 low_res. Then communicate image data.
We also need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and waypoint1. For that we need to have soil analysis at those waypoints. We can sample soil at those waypoints. We also need to communicate soil data via a lander. The lander is at
