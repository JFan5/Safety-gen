analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint4, 9; communicated_rock_data waypoint11,0,2,8; communicated_image_data objective1 colour, objective3 low_res, objective2 high_res. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint0 initially, rover1 at waypoint6. They can traverse along edges defined. We need to collect soil samples at waypoint0,4,6,8,9? Wait soil samples at 0,4,6,8,9. Rock samples at 0,2,4,5,8,9,11. We need to communicate data for rock samples at 0,2,8,11. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints and communicate.
Also need to communicate soil data at 4 and 9. So need to sample soil at 4 and 9.
Also need to take images for objectives 1,3,2 with specified modes.
We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold.
We need to produce a plan. Let's design.
We have two rovers. Let's use rover0 to collect soil at 4 and 9, and rock at 0,2,8,11. Rover1 can also help.
But we need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously. Initially rover0 at 0, rover1 at 6. So fine.
We need to navigate rovers to appropriate waypoints.
We need to have each rover equipped for soil, rock, imaging. They are equipped.
We need to have store for each rover: rover0store, rover1store. They are empty initially.
We need to sample soil: sample_soil action requires at rover at waypoint with soil sample, equipped, store empty. After sample, store becomes full, soil analysis recorded, sample removed.
Then we need to communicate data: communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at waypoint, at lander at another waypoint, have_soil_analysis, visible, available, channel_free. Lander general at waypoint1 initially. So we need to navigate rover to a waypoint visible from lander. The visible pairs defined. For example, visible waypoint0 waypoint1, etc. So we can have rover at waypoint0 (where soil sample exists) and lander at waypoint1. They are visible
