analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective2 colour and low_res. We have two rovers, each with store, cameras. Cameras support modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res; camera1 supports high_res, low_res; camera2 supports colour, high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective0. So to take image for objective2, we need a camera that supports colour or low_res? We need to take image for objective2 with colour and low_res. But only camera1 supports low_res. camera0 supports colour. camera2 supports colour. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective0? Wait calibration target is camera0 objective0. So camera0 can only be calibrated for objective0. But we need to take image for objective2. The action take_image requires calibrated camera i for rover r. So we need to calibrate camera for objective2. But calibration_target only defined for camera0 and camera2 for objective0, camera1 for objective1. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r). So camera must be calibrated for that rover. Calibration target is camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. So maybe we can take image for objective2 with any camera that supports the mode? Wait the action take_image requires (calibrated ?i ?r) and (supports ?i ?m). So camera must be calibrated for that rover, but not necessarily for the objective. The calibration target is just a property of camera. But the calibration target is used in calibrate action: precondition includes (calibration_target ?i ?t). So to calibrate camera i for rover r, we need to specify a target objective t. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, camera1 for objective1, camera2 for objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The action take_image doesn't require that the objective matches the calibration target. It only requires that the camera is calibrated for that rover. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, then take image for objective2 with camera0. That seems allowed. So we
