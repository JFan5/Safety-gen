analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective0 low_res and objective0 colour. We have two cameras: camera0 supports colour, high_res; camera2 supports high_res, low_res. We need to take images of objective0 with low_res and colour. We need to calibrate cameras for objective0. Cameras have calibration_target: camera0 -> objective2, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective1. So camera0 cannot calibrate for objective0. camera2 supports low_res and high_res, but calibration_target is objective1. So camera2 cannot calibrate for objective0 either. Wait, camera2 supports low_res, high_res, but calibration_target is objective1. So cannot calibrate for objective0. So how to get image of objective0? The action take_image requires calibrated camera. But we can calibrate camera for objective0? The calibration action requires calibration_target camera i t. So only cameras with calibration_target matching objective. None match objective0. So impossible? Maybe we can use camera0 to take image without calibration? But precondition requires calibrated. So we need to calibrate camera for objective0. But no camera has calibration_target objective0. So maybe we can use camera1? It supports colour, but calibration_target is objective3. So no. So maybe we can use camera2? It supports low_res, high_res, but calibration_target objective1. So no. So impossible to satisfy goal? But maybe we can use camera0 to take image of objective0 with colour? Wait camera0 supports colour, but calibration_target is objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective0. So maybe we can use camera2 to take image of objective0 with low_res? It supports low_res, but calibration_target is objective1. So cannot calibrate for objective0. So impossible.
But maybe we can circumvent by using the fact that the goal only requires communicated_image_data objective0 low_res and colour. But we can achieve that by taking image with camera2 low_res? But we need to calibrate camera2 for objective0. But we cannot calibrate because calibration_target mismatch. So maybe we can use camera0 to take image of objective0 with colour? But camera0 supports colour, but calibration_target is objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective0. So impossible.
Wait, maybe we can use camera0 to calibrate for objective0 by using calibration_target? The calibration action requires calibration_target camera i t. So if we
