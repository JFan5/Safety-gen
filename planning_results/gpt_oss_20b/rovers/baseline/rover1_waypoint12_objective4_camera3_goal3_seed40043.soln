analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_image_data objective3 low_res, objective0 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint4? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint6 must happen before at rover0 waypoint4. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover is at waypoint6 before it is at waypoint4. So the sequence must have at waypoint6 earlier than at waypoint4.
We need to produce a plan that achieves the communicated image data for those objectives. The plan must involve calibrating cameras, taking images, communicating image data. We have cameras: camera0 target objective0, supports high_res and low_res. camera1 target objective2, supports high_res and low_res. camera2 target objective1, supports colour, high_res. We need images for objective3 low_res, objective0 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 high_res. Wait objective3 low_res is not directly supported by any camera? camera0 supports high_res and low_res, camera1 supports high_res and low_res, camera2 supports colour and high_res. None supports low_res for objective3. But we can take image with camera0 or camera1? They support low_res. So we can take image for objective3 low_res using camera0 or camera1. But camera0 target is objective0, camera1 target is objective2. But calibration_target indicates which camera is used for which objective. But calibration_target is a predicate that indicates that camera i is calibration target for objective t. But calibration action requires that calibration_target camera i objective t. So camera0 can only calibrate objective0, camera1 objective2, camera2 objective1. So to take image for objective3, we need a camera that supports objective3? None. But maybe we can use camera0 or camera1 to take image for objective3? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r) (on_board ?i ?r) (equipped_for_imaging ?r) (supports ?i ?m) (visible_from ?o ?p) (at ?r ?p). It doesn't require that camera's calibration_target matches objective. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, then use it to take image for objective3? But the camera supports low_res, so we can take
