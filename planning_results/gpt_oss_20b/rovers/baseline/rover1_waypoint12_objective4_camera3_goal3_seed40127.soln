analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,10,11,4; communicated_image_data for objective3 colour and high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint6. Also must satisfy all preconditions.
We need to produce a sequence of actions. We have actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,10,11,4. They are initially at those waypoints: at_soil_sample at waypoint1,2,4,5,7,9,10,11. Wait: at_soil_sample at waypoint1,2,4,5,7,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at waypoint2,10,11,4. So we need to navigate to those waypoints, sample soil, then communicate soil data.
Also need to take images for objective3 with colour and high_res. objective3 visible_from many waypoints: 1,2,4,5,6,9,11. We need to calibrate camera for objective3? The calibration_target for camera0 is objective2, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. None for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective3. But we can still take image? The action take_image requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera for objective3. But we don't have calibration_target for objective3. So maybe we cannot take image for objective3. But the goal requires communicated_image_data objective3 colour and high_res. That means we need to take image and communicate. But we cannot calibrate for objective3. Wait maybe we can calibrate any camera for any objective? The calibration_target predicate indicates which objective a camera is calibrated for. For camera0, target is objective2; camera1 target objective1; camera2 target objective2. So no camera for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective3. But maybe we can still take image if we calibrate camera for objective3? The precondition for calibrate action: (calibration_target ?i ?t). So we cannot calibrate for objective3. So we cannot take image for objective3. But the goal requires communicated_image_data objective3 colour and high
