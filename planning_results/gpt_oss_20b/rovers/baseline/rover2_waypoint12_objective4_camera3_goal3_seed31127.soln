analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a complex planning problem with many actions. We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoints 3,5,7,11; communicated_rock_data for 11,7,1,6; communicated_image_data for objective2 low_res, objective3 low_res, objective2 colour.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They have stores. They can traverse between waypoints. They can sample soil or rock, drop, calibrate, take image, communicate data. They need to be at waypoints to sample, then communicate.
We need to satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint7 or 8 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that uses available actions.
We need to consider that each rover has a store that can hold one sample. They can sample soil or rock if at sample location and equipped. They can drop to empty store. They can communicate data via lander general at waypoint5. The lander is at waypoint5. The lander must be at waypoint5 to communicate. The lander is at waypoint5. The lander must be channel_free initially. The actions communicate_* require at_lander at some waypoint y, visible from x to y, etc.
We need to ensure that the rover is at the waypoint where sample is located, then sample, then drop to store, then communicate. But the communication action requires that the rover is at some waypoint x, the lander at y, and visible between x and y. The visible relations are given. For example, visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Let's check: visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? In init, visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Actually visible waypoint5 to waypoint7 is not listed. But visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not listed. But visible waypoint5 to waypoint7 is not listed. But visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Wait, visible relations: visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Not listed. visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not listed. So maybe not visible. But visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not present. So cannot communicate from waypoint7 to waypoint5? But we need to communicate data from waypoint7. The lander is at waypoint5. So we need visible from waypoint7 to waypoint5. Not present. So maybe we need to move rover to waypoint5 to communicate. But the sample at waypoint7 is at waypoint7.
