analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,5; communicated_rock_data for waypoint3,4,8,9; communicated_image_data for objective0 low_res, objective1 low_res, objective3 high_res. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint1 or waypoint3 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint6 respectively. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They have stores empty. They can traverse between waypoints as defined.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,5,7. Rock samples at 3,4,7,8,9. But goal only requires communicated data for some of them: soil at 2,5; rock at 3,4,8,9. Also need images for objectives 0,1,3.
We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data. Also drop to empty store.
We must ensure that after sampling, we have data to communicate. For soil data, we need have_soil_analysis at waypoint. For rock data, have_rock_analysis. For image data, have_image.
We also need to ensure that we have the data before communicating. Also we need to ensure that we have the store to hold data. The store is empty initially. We can sample and store data in store. Then communicate.
We need to ensure that we have the data in the store before communicating. The communicate actions require have_soil_analysis, have_rock_analysis, have_image. They also require that the rover is at a waypoint visible to the lander, and that the lander is at a waypoint. The lander is at waypoint10. The visible relations are defined for many pairs. We need to ensure that the rover is at a waypoint visible to the lander. The visible relations are defined for many pairs. For example, visible waypoint10 waypoint8, etc. We need to check which waypoints are visible to the lander at waypoint10. The visible relations include visible waypoint10 waypoint8, visible waypoint10 waypoint3, visible waypoint10 waypoint11, visible waypoint10 waypoint2, visible waypoint10 waypoint8, visible waypoint10 waypoint3, visible waypoint10 waypoint11, visible waypoint10 waypoint2
