analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_rock_data waypoint3, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must be at waypoint4 before it is at waypoint2. So order: at waypoint4 before at waypoint2. Also we must ensure that the plan steps satisfy preconditions.
We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint4. So at start, at waypoint4. So constraint satisfied: at waypoint4 before at waypoint2? Wait constraint says sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means at some point, rover0 at waypoint4 must occur before at some point rover0 at waypoint2. Since initial state is at waypoint4, that condition is satisfied. So we don't need to enforce anything else.
Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_rock_data waypoint3, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint5, rock sample at waypoint3, and image data for objective1 high_res.
We have sample_soil action requires at_soil_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store empty, etc. We have store rover0store empty initially. So we can sample soil at waypoint2 and waypoint5. But we need to be at those waypoints. We start at waypoint4. We can navigate to waypoint2, 5, 3. We need to navigate to each waypoint.
We also need to have have_soil_analysis at those waypoints to communicate. Then communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at some other waypoint, have_soil_analysis at that waypoint, visible between them, available rover, channel_free. We have lander general at waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to communicate? Wait: communicate_soil_data requires at ?r ?x, at_lander ?l ?y, have_soil_analysis ?r ?p, visible ?x ?y, available ?r, channel_free ?l. So we need to be at some waypoint x, and lander at y. The lander is at waypoint4. So we need to be at a waypoint visible from waypoint4. Many waypoints visible from 4: 0,2,5,1
