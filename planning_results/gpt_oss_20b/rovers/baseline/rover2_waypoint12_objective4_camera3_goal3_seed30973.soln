analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data at waypoint6 and waypoint3, communicated_rock_data at waypoint11,4,1,8, communicated_image_data objective3 high_res, objective2 colour.
We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint1 simultaneously, never both at waypoint8 simultaneously.
We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.
We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold.
We need to use only objects defined.
We need to produce a plan that is valid. We don't need to optimize, just produce any plan that achieves the goal.
We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint4, rover1 at waypoint1. There are samples at various waypoints: at rock samples at 1,3,4,7,8,10,11; soil samples at 3,6,9,11. We need to collect soil data at waypoint6 and 3. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. For rock data at 11,4,1,8. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints. Also need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective2 colour. We have cameras: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1, camera2 on rover0. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective0, camera2 -> objective2. They support certain modes: camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports colour and high_res, camera2 supports high_res. We need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective2 colour. Wait objective2 is target of camera2, which supports high_res. But we need objective2 colour. But camera2 supports high_res only. So we cannot take colour image with camera2. But we need objective2 colour. But we could use camera0 or camera1 to take colour image of objective2. But camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports colour. So we can use camera0 or camera1 to take image of objective2 in colour mode. But we need to calibrate camera to objective2. Calibration target for camera0 is objective1,
