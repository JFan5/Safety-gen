analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective2 high_res. We have a rover0 at waypoint0 initially. We need to get to a waypoint that can see objective2, then take image with high_res mode, then communicate to lander general. Constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint3). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint6 must happen before at rover0 waypoint3. So we must ensure that in plan, we visit waypoint6 before waypoint3.
Goal: communicated_image_data objective2 high_res. That requires have_image rover0 objective2 high_res, then communicate_image_data action.
We need to have have_image. To get have_image, we need to calibrate camera, then take_image. Calibration requires: equipped_for_imaging rover0, calibration_target camera0 objective0? Wait calibration_target camera0 objective0. But we need to calibrate camera0 for objective0? But we need to take image of objective2. The camera0 is calibration_target objective0. camera1 is calibration_target objective2. So we need to calibrate camera1 for objective2. So we need to calibrate camera1 at a waypoint that can see objective2. The visible_from objective2 includes waypoint1,2,3,5,7. So we need to be at one of those waypoints, with camera1 on board, and visible_from objective2 waypoint. Also we need to be at that waypoint to calibrate camera1. Then take_image with camera1, mode high_res, at that waypoint. Then communicate_image_data to lander general.
We also need to satisfy constraints: at rover0 waypoint6 before at rover0 waypoint3. So we must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3. We can plan path: start at waypoint0, go to waypoint6, then to waypoint3, etc.
We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3? Wait visible_from objective2 includes waypoint3. So we can take image at waypoint3. But we must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3. So we can go: waypoint0 -> waypoint6 -> waypoint3. That satisfies constraint.
We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3. Yes.
We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3. So we can calibrate camera1 at waypoint3. But we need to be at waypoint3 to calibrate camera1.
