analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint9,8,5,6; communicated_rock_data for waypoint0,6; communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint6 simultaneously.
We have two rovers, each with store. They can sample soil and rock, then communicate. They need to be at waypoints with samples. They can sample at waypoint0,5,6,8,9 etc. Let's analyze.
Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint9,8,5,6. That means each of these waypoints must have have_soil_analysis by a rover, then communicate_soil_data action. Similarly rock data for waypoint0 and 6. Also image data for objective2 colour and high_res. That requires take_image with camera0 or camera1? camera0 supports low_res only. camera1 supports colour and high_res. So to get colour and high_res images of objective2, we need to calibrate camera1 to objective2, then take_image with camera1 at some waypoint visible from objective2. visible_from objective2 includes waypoint2,4,6,7,8. So we can have rover1 at waypoint6 (but constraint prohibits both rovers at waypoint6 simultaneously). But we can have rover1 at waypoint6 to take image. But we need to ensure not both at waypoint6. So we can have rover0 at some other waypoint.
We need to plan actions for each rover.
We need to consider that each rover has store empty initially. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints where sample exists. They can drop to empty store. They can communicate data via communicate actions.
We need to ensure that each rover has the necessary equipment: rover0 has equipped_for_soil_analysis and imaging. rover1 has all three.
We need to ensure that each rover can traverse to required waypoints.
We need to ensure that each rover can communicate via lander general at waypoint5. Lander at waypoint5. So to communicate, the rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander. visible_from? Actually visible is defined between waypoints. The visible predicate indicates visibility between waypoints. For communicate actions, precondition requires visible ?x ?y where ?x is rover's waypoint, ?y is lander's waypoint. So the rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander at waypoint5. Let's check visible pairs: visible
