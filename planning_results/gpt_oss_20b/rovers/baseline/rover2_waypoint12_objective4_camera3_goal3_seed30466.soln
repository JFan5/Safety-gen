analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated soil data for waypoint3,9,5,4; communicated rock data for waypoint1,5; communicated image data for objective1 low_res, colour; objective3 colour; objective2 low_res. Also constraints: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint9 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint10 initially, rover1 at waypoint2. They can traverse along edges defined by can_traverse. They can sample soil/rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data.
Goal: need to collect soil samples at waypoint3,9,5,4. But initial at waypoint3 has soil sample, at waypoint9 soil sample, at waypoint5 soil sample, at waypoint4 soil sample. Wait initial states: at_soil_sample waypoint3, at_soil_sample waypoint4, at_soil_sample waypoint5, at_soil_sample waypoint9. So all four soil samples present. We need to communicate soil data for each. That requires have_soil_analysis by a rover at that waypoint. So each rover must sample soil at each waypoint and then communicate.
Similarly rock samples at waypoint1,5,6,7,11. But goal only requires communicated rock data for waypoint1 and 5. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.
Also need to take images for objectives: objective1 low_res and colour, objective3 colour, objective2 low_res. Each objective has visible_from waypoints. For objective1 visible_from: waypoint1,3,5,6,7,10,11. For objective3 visible_from: waypoint6,9. For objective2 visible_from: 0,1,2,4,6,9,10,11.
We need to take images at those waypoints and communicate image data for each objective-mode pair.
We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective3, camera2 objective2. So each camera must be calibrated for its target objective. Calibration requires at rover at waypoint, visible_from target, on_board camera, etc.
We have cameras on rovers: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1, camera2 on rover0. So camera0 and camera2 on rover0, camera1 on rover1.
We need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. Then take images at visible waypoints for each objective.
We need to ensure that at
