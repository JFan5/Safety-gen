analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint9, waypoint1, communicated_rock_data waypoint10,7,11, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res, objective1 colour, objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint7 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint1 initially, rover1 at waypoint7 initially. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints with samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint3. They can take images and communicate image data.
We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.
We need to ensure that at no point both rovers are at waypoint7 simultaneously. Initially rover1 is at waypoint7, rover0 at waypoint1. So we must avoid moving rover0 to waypoint7 while rover1 remains there. We can move rover0 away from waypoint7 before moving rover1 away.
Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint9 and waypoint1. Soil samples at waypoint1,4,5,6,7,9,10. So we need to sample soil at waypoint1 and 9. For soil sample at waypoint1: already at waypoint1 initially. So rover0 can sample soil at waypoint1. For soil sample at waypoint9: need to reach waypoint9. We can move rover0 to waypoint9 via traversals. Path: waypoint1 -> waypoint3? Actually visible edges: visible waypoint1 to waypoint3, etc. But can_traverse edges: we have can_traverse for rover0: waypoint1 to 0,2,3,6,8,9,10. So from waypoint1 to waypoint9 is possible via can_traverse? There is can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9? Yes, can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9. So rover0 can go directly to waypoint9. So we can sample soil at waypoint9.
Similarly rock samples at waypoint10,7,11. We need to sample rock at those waypoints. For rock sample at waypoint10: can_traverse rover0 to waypoint10. For rock sample at waypoint7: can_traverse rover0 to waypoint7? There is can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 to 7? Actually can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 to 7? Not listed. But can_traverse rover0
