analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint6, communicated_image_data objective1 low_res, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint7) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must visit waypoint7 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint7 must happen before at rover0 waypoint0. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint7 before it is at waypoint0. Currently initial state: at rover0 waypoint7. So constraint satisfied? Wait constraint says sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint7) (at rover0 waypoint0). That means the action that makes rover at waypoint7 must occur before the action that makes rover at waypoint0. Since initial state is at waypoint7, that condition is satisfied. But we must ensure that we don't violate it by visiting waypoint0 before waypoint7. Since we start at waypoint7, we can go to waypoint0 later. So fine.
Goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint6. That requires have_rock_analysis at waypoint6, and then communicate_rock_data action. We have at_rock_sample at waypoint6 initially. So we need to sample rock at waypoint6. But we need to be at waypoint6, have rock analysis, and then communicate. Also we need to communicate image data for objective1 low_res and objective0 high_res. That requires have_image for those objectives with modes. We need to take images at appropriate waypoints visible to objectives.
We have visible_from objective1 waypoint5. So to take image for objective1, we need to be at waypoint5, have camera on board, calibrated for objective1, and visible_from objective1 waypoint5. Also we need to calibrate camera for objective1. Calibration requires at rover at waypoint, calibration_target camera1 objective1, on_board camera1, visible_from objective1 waypoint5. So we can calibrate at waypoint5. Then take image at waypoint5 with camera1, objective1, low_res. But we need to support low_res. camera1 supports low_res. Good.
Similarly for objective0 high_res: visible_from objective0 waypoint0,3,4,5,7. We can take image at waypoint0 with camera0 high_res. camera0 supports high_res. So we need to be at waypoint0, calibrate camera0 for objective0, then take image.
We also need to sample rock at waypoint
