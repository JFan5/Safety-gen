analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint2 and communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint3) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must visit waypoint3 before waypoint4? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint3 must happen before at rover0 waypoint4. So sequence must have at3 before at4.
We need to get rock data at waypoint2. There is at_rock_sample waypoint2 initially. To communicate rock data, we need have_rock_analysis at that waypoint. So we need to sample rock at waypoint2. But sample_rock action requires at rover at waypoint2, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of store empty. We have store rover0store empty. So we need to navigate to waypoint2, sample rock, then communicate rock data via lander general at some waypoint that is visible from rover's current location. The communicate_rock_data action requires at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_rock_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. After communicating, channel_free toggles? The effect sets channel_free? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: not channel_free then channel_free? Actually effect sets not channel_free then channel_free? That is weird. But we can ignore.
We also need to communicate image data objective0 low_res. That requires have_image at rover at some waypoint, visible from that waypoint to lander, etc. We need to take image of objective0 low_res. objective0 visible_from waypoint0,2,3. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective0. We can take image at waypoint0,2,3. We need to calibrate camera0 for low_res mode. camera0 supports low_res. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0? Wait calibrate action requires at rover w, visible_from t w, on_board camera, calibration_target camera0 objective1. So calibration target is objective1, not objective0. So we cannot calibrate for objective0. But we can still take image of objective0 low_res without calibration? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective1? But we need image of objective0. The calibration_target is objective1
