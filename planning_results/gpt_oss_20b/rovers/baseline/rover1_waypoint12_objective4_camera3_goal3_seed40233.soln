analysisWe need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint9, waypoint4; communicated_rock_data waypoint1,9,4,5; communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res, objective0 colour. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must visit waypoint0 before waypoint2? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint0 must happen before at rover0 waypoint2. So we must ensure that in plan, the action that moves rover to waypoint0 occurs before the action that moves rover to waypoint2. Also we must satisfy all preconditions.
We need to produce a valid plan. Let's analyze initial state.
Initial state: rover0 at waypoint10. It has all equipment. There are samples at various waypoints: at_rock_sample at 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. at_soil_sample at 3,4,7,9,10. So we need to collect soil samples at waypoint9 and 4. Also rock samples at 1,9,4,5. So we need to sample at those waypoints. Then communicate data to lander general at waypoint0. Lander at waypoint0. So we need to travel to waypoint0 to communicate. But we also need to collect images for objectives 2,3,0. For each objective, we need to calibrate camera and take image. Then communicate image data to lander.
We need to ensure that we have at least one image for each objective. The goal requires communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res, objective0 colour. So we need to take images with those modes.
We have cameras: camera0 supports colour, high_res. calibration_target camera0 objective3. camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res. calibration_target camera1 objective0. camera2 supports colour, high_res, low_res. calibration_target camera2 objective2.
Thus we need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. For objective3, camera0. For objective0, camera1. For objective2, camera2.
We need to take images at visible_from positions for each objective. For objective0 visible_from includes waypoint0,1,2,4,8,9,10,11. For objective1 visible_from includes 1,5,6,8,10. For objective2 visible_from includes 4,5,7
