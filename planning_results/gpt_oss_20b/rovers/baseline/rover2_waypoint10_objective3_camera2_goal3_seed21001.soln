analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, two stores, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, modes. The goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint6, communicated_soil_data waypoint0, communicated_rock_data waypoint8, 7,3,4, and communicated_image_data objective0 colour, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these. We must obey constraints: never both rovers at waypoint0 simultaneously.
We need to consider the initial state: rover0 at waypoint6, rover1 at waypoint9. Both available. They have stores empty. They are equipped for soil, rock, imaging. Cameras on board: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0. Calibration targets: camera0 objective2, camera1 objective1. Supports: camera0 high_res, low_res; camera1 colour.
We need to get soil samples at waypoint6 and waypoint0. At initial state, at_soil_sample at waypoint0 and waypoint6. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. We need to communicate soil data for those waypoints. Also rock samples at 8,7,3,4. At initial state, rock samples at 0,1,3,4,7,8. Wait initial state: at_rock_sample waypoint0,1,3,4,7,8. So we need to sample rock at 8,7,3,4. We need to communicate rock data for those waypoints. Also we need to take images for objectives 0,1,2 with specified modes: objective0 colour, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour. We have cameras: camera0 supports high_res and low_res; camera1 supports colour. So we can take images for objective0 with camera0? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint1,2,3,4,5,8. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective0. We can take image from any waypoint that is visible_from objective0. We need to calibrate camera0 to objective2 (target). For camera0, calibration_target camera0 objective2. So we can calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that is visible_from objective2. Visible_from objective2 includes waypoint0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9. So we can calibrate camera0 at any of those. Then we can take image for
