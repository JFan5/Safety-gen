analysisWe need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint1, communicated_image_data objective1 colour, communicated_image_data objective2 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6). That means at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint6. So the plan must include that ordering.
We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. So at start, at waypoint5. We need to eventually be at waypoint6. So we need to navigate from 5 to 6. But we also need to sample soil at waypoint1, sample rock at some points, etc. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint1. That requires have_soil_analysis at waypoint1. So we need to sample soil at waypoint1. The sample_soil action requires at rover at waypoint1, at_soil_sample at waypoint1, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store_of store, empty store. Initially, store empty. So we can sample soil at waypoint1. Then we need to communicate soil data to lander general. The communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint x, at_lander at y, have_soil_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. Initially channel_free general. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. General at waypoint4. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint4. Many visible pairs. For example, visible waypoint4 to waypoint3, etc. We can navigate to waypoint4 or any visible. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at waypoint5 before at waypoint6. So we need to navigate from 5 to 6 eventually. We can navigate to 4 then to 6. But we need to be at waypoint4 to communicate? Actually we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. Let's check visible pairs: visible waypoint4 to waypoint3, visible waypoint4 to waypoint1, visible waypoint4 to waypoint2, visible waypoint4 to waypoint5, visible waypoint4 to waypoint6. So we can be at waypoint4 or 3 or 1 or 2 or 5 or 6. But we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. So we can navigate to waypoint4. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at waypoint5 before at waypoint6. So we can navigate from 5 to 4 to 6. That satisfies ordering
