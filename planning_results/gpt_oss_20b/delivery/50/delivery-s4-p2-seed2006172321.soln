commentary# Plan Generation
# 1. Parse the PROBLEM section
#    - Objects:
#        cells: c_0_0 ... c_3_3
#        packages: p1, p2
#        trucks: t1
#    - Initial facts:
#        pick up location: p2 at c_0_3
#        delivery location: p1 at c_3_1
#        t1 at c_0_2
#        t1 empty
#        adjacency facts (bidirectional)
#    - Goal:
#        p1 at c_3_0
#        p2 at c_3_0
#    - Constraints:
#        - PDDL3: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0))
#          => t1 must visit c_0_0 at some point before the goal is achieved.
# 2. Domain actions:
#    - pick-package(t, p, x):
#        pre: at p x & at t x & empty t
#        effect: drop empty t & carrying t p
#    - drop-package(t, p, x):
#        pre: at t x & carrying t p
#        effect: empty t & at p x
#    - move(t, from, to):
#        pre: adjacent from to & at t from & not (= from to)
#        effect: at t to & last t from
# 3. Constraints & invariants:
#    - Invariants:
#        * package-location: (forall (?p - package) (at-most-one ?p - locatable))
#        * truck-location:   (forall (?t - truck)   (at-most-one ?t - locatable))
#        * package-truck:    (forall (?t - truck) (forall (?p - package)
#                                   (at-most-one ?t ?p)))
#    - Constraint:
#        * sometime (at t1 c_0_0)
# 4. Planning strategy
#    - Goal-directed search with constraint handling.
#    - Since there's a "sometime" constraint, we must ensure t1 visits c_0_0.
#    - We can incorporate this visit either:
#        a) before picking up any package,
#        b) between pick-up and drop-off,
#        c) after dropping both packages (but before goal check).
