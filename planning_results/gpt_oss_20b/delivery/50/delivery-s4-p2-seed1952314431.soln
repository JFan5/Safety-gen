analysisWe must produce a plan for the delivery domain with constraints. The problem includes a PDDL3 constraint:
(:constraints
(sometime (at t1 c_0_0))
)
So the plan must ensure that at some point during execution, truck t1 is at cell c_0_0. The goal is:
(at p1 c_2_1) (at p2 c_2_1)
So both packages must be at cell c_2_1.
Initial positions:
- t1 at c_2_2, empty.
- p2 at c_3_2.
- p1 at c_1_0.
We need to move both packages to c_2_1. Also, at some point, t1 must be at c_0_0.
We must consider the map adjacency. Let's list all cells and adjacencies:
Cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3,
c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3,
c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2, c_2_3,
c_3_0, c_3_1, c_3_2, c_3_3
Adjacencies (undirected, but listed as directed pairs):
c_0_1 c_0_2
c_1_1 c_0_1
c_1_3 c_1_2
c_2_1 c_3_1
c_2_0 c_3_0
c_2_1 c_2_0
c_0_0 c_0_1
c_2_1 c_2_2
c_3_1 c_3_2
