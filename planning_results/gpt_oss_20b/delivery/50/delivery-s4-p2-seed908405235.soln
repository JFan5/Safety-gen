commentaryWe need to generate a plan for the delivery domain with the given problem. The domain includes constraints requirement. There is a constraint in the problem: (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0))). That means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. The goal requires p1 at c_3_1 and p2 at c_3_1. So both packages must end at c_3_1. Initially: p1 at c_0_0, p2 at c_1_3, t1 at c_2_1, empty t1. So t1 must go to c_0_0 at some point, then eventually deliver both packages to c_3_1. We must pick p1 first (since it's at c_0_0, same as t1's constraint location). But t1 must be at c_0_0 at some point; we could move t1 to c_0_0, pick p1, then deliver to c_3_1, then go to c_1_3 to pick p2, deliver to c_3_1. But we must also satisfy the constraint that t1 is at c_0_0 at some point; after picking p1, t1 will be at c_0_0 carrying p1, so that satisfies. So we can do: move t1 from c_2_1 to c_1_1, to c_0_1, to c_0_0. Then pick-package t1 p1 c_0_0. Then move t1 to c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3, c_2_3, c_3_3, c_3_2, c_3_1. Then drop-package t1 p1 c_3_1. Then move t1 to c_2_3, c_1_3. pick-package t1 p2 c_1_3. Then move t1 to c_2_3, c_3_3, c_3_2, c_3_1. drop-package t1 p2 c_3_1. Goal achieved. Need to ensure all preconditions: pick requires empty t1; after first pick, t1 is not empty. So we cannot move after picking until dropping. So sequence
