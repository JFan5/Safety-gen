commentary# Plan Generation
# 1. Parse the PDDL problem
#    - Domain: delivery
#    - Objects:
#        cells: c_0_0 c_0_1 c_0_2 c_0_3 c_1_0 c_1_1 c_1_2 c_1_3 c_2_0 c_2_1 c_2_2 c_2_3 c_3_0 c_3_1 c_3_2 c_3_3
#        packages: p1 p2
#        trucks: t1
# 2. Initial state facts
#    - adjacencies (symmetric, but listed explicitly)
#    - at p2 c_1_1
#    - at t1 c_3_3
#    - at p1 c_3_3
#    - empty t1
#    - Goal: at p1 c_0_2 AND at p2 c_0_2
# 3. PDDL3 constraint:
#    - (sometime (at t1 c_0_0))
#      => t1 must visit c_0_0 at least once during the plan.
# 4. Goal analysis
#    - Both packages must end at c_0_2.
#    - p1 starts at c_3_3.
#    - p2 starts at c_1_1.
#    - t1 starts at c_3_3 and is empty.
# 5. Path planning
#    - Compute shortest paths:
#      * c_3_3 -> c_0_2:
#          c_3_3 -> c_2_3 -> c_1_3 -> c_0_3 -> c_0_2
#          (length 4)
#      * c_1_1 -> c_0_2:
#          c_1_1 -> c_0_1 -> c_0_2
#          (length 2)
# 6. Constraint integration
#    - t1 must also reach c_0_0 at some point.
#    - c_0_0 is reachable from c_0_2 via:
#          c_0_2 -> c_0_1 -> c_0_0
#      (length 2)
#    - Incorporate this
