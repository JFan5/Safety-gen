commentary# Plan Generation
# 1. Parse the PDDL components
#    - Domain: actions, types, predicates, requirements, constraints
#    - Problem: objects, init, goal, constraints
# 2. Build the internal representation
#    - Type hierarchy:
#        object
#            locatable
#                package
#                truck
#            cell
#    - Predicate definitions:
#        at (?x1 - locatable ?x2 - cell)
#        carrying (?x1 - truck ?x2 - package)
#        empty (?x1 - truck)
#        adjacent (?x1 - cell ?x2 - cell)
#        last (?t - truck ?c - cell)
# 3. Initialize the state
#    - at p1 c_2_0
#    - at t1 c_0_0
#    - empty t1
#    - All adjacent relations as given
#    - No package or truck is carrying anything initially
#    - No 'last' facts initially
# 4. Understand the goal and constraints
#    - Goal: (at p1 c_1_2)
#    - Constraint: (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
#      This means that at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0.
#      Since t1 starts at c_0_0, the constraint is trivially satisfied at step 0.
#      Therefore, we do NOT need to return to c_0_0 unless the goal or other constraints
#      force us to.  The only goal is to move p1 to c_1_2.
# 5. Generate a plan
#    - Strategy:
#        a) Move the truck to the package location (c_2_0).
#        b) Pick up the package.
#        c) Move the truck to the goal location (c_1_2).
#        d) Drop the package.
# 6. Compute the shortest paths
#    - Truck from c_0_0 to c_2_0:
#        c_0_0 -> c_1_0 -> c_2_0   (2 moves)
#    - Package from c_2_0 to c_1_2:
#        c_2_0 -> c_2_1 -> c_1_
