commentary# Plan Generation for Delivery Domain (3x3 grid, 2 packages)
# Initial State:
# - t1 at c_1_0
# - p2 at c_0_2
# - p1 at c_2_2
# - t1 empty
# Goal:
# - p1 at c_0_0
# - p2 at c_0_0
# Constraint:
# - c_0_0 must be visited by t1 at some time (sometime constraint)
# Strategy:
# 1. Move t1 to c_0_0 to satisfy the sometime constraint.
# 2. Pick up p1 (currently at c_2_2) by first transporting t1 to c_2_2.
#    Path: c_0_0 -> c_0_1 -> c_0_2 -> c_1_2 -> c_2_2
# 3. Deliver p1 to c_0_0 while carrying it.
#    Path: c_2_2 -> c_1_2 -> c_0_2 -> c_0_1 -> c_0_0
# 4. Drop p1 at c_0_0.
# 5. Pick up p2 (currently at c_0_2) while still at c_0_0.
# 6. Transport t1 with p2 to c_0_0 (already there), so just drop p2.
#    However, p2 is at c_0_2; we need to move to c_0_2 first, pick it up,
#    then return to c_0_0, and drop it.
# Detailed Sequence:
# Step 1: Move t1 from c_1_0 to c_0_0
#   Preconditions: adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0, at t1 c_1_0, not (= c_1_0 c_0_0)
#   Effect: at t1 c_0_0, not at t1 c_1_0, last t1 c_1_0
move t1 c_1_0 c_0_0
# Step 2: Move t1 from c_0_0 to c_0_1
move t1 c_0_0 c_0_1
# Step 3: Move t1
