commentary# Plan Generation
# 1. Parse the PDDL components
#    - Domain: actions, types, predicates, requirements, constraints
#    - Problem: objects, initial state, goal, constraints
# 2. Build the internal representations
#    - Type hierarchy:
#        locatable > object
#        package > locatable
#        truck > locatable
#        cell > object
#    - Predicate definitions:
#        at ?x1 - locatable ?x2 - cell
#        carrying ?x1 - truck ?x2 - package
#        empty ?x1 - truck
#        adjacent ?x1 - cell ?x2 - cell
#        last ?t - truck ?c - cell
# 3. Initialize the state
#    - at p1 c_2_1
#    - at t1 c_1_1
#    - empty t1
#    - All adjacent relations as given
#    - No carrying facts initially
# 4. Understand the constraints
#    - (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
#      This is a PDDL3 temporal constraint:
#      * "sometime" requires that at some point during the plan execution,
#        the condition (at t1 c_0_0) holds.
#    - Goal: (at p1 c_0_0)
# 5. Generate a plan that satisfies:
#    - The goal
#    - The PDDL3 constraint
#    - All action preconditions
#    - All domain constraints (typing, equality, negative-preconditions, constraints)
# 6. Search strategy
#    - Use a temporal planner approach:
#      * Maintain a timeline of facts with start and end times.
#      * Actions have durations:
#          pick-package: 0
#          drop-package: 0
#          move: 1
#    - Constraints:
#      * empty t1 is a fact that must hold before pick-package.
#      * carrying t1 p1 and empty t1 are mutually exclusive (due to empty t1 being negated in pick-package).
#      * at t1 c_0_0 must hold at some time (sometime).
#      * at p1 c_0_0 is the goal (must hold at the end).
#    - No other invariants or
