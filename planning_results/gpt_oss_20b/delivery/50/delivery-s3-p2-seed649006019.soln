commentaryWe need to solve the delivery domain instance. Let's analyze.
Cells: 3x3 grid:
c_0_0 c_0_1 c_0_2
c_1_0 c_1_1 c_1_2
c_2_0 c_2_1 c_2_2
Adjacencies given: basically each cell adjacent to its up/down/left/right neighbors. Let's confirm: c_0_0 adjacent to c_1_0 and c_0_1. yes. c_0_2 adjacent to c_1_2 and c_0_1. yes. c_2_2 adjacent to c_1_2 and c_2_1. yes. So grid is correct.
Initial:
t1 at c_1_0
p2 at c_2_1
p1 at c_0_2
empty t1
Goal:
p1 at c_0_1
p2 at c_0_1
Constraint:
(:constraints
(sometime (at t1 c_0_0))
)
So t1 must be at c_0_0 at some point during plan (not necessarily goal). That's a PDDL3 constraint. Must satisfy.
Thus plan must move t1 to c_0_0 at some step, then eventually deliver packages to c_0_1.
We need to compute a sequence of move, pick-package, drop-package actions.
Let's map locations:
c_0_0: top-left
c_0_1: top-middle
c_0_2: top-right
c_1_0: middle-left
c_1_1: center
c_1_2: middle-right
c_2_0: bottom-left
c_2_1: bottom-middle
c_2_2: bottom-right
Packages:
p1 at c_0_2 (top-right)
p2 at c_2_1 (bottom-middle)
Goal: both at c_0_1 (top-middle).
t1 starts at c_1_0 (middle-left).
We need to plan.
Let's compute shortest paths:
From c_1_0 to c_0_0: up. So move t1 from c_1_0 to c_0_0. That's one move. That satisfies constraint.
From c_0_0 to c_0_1: right. So move
