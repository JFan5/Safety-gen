analysisWe need to produce a plan for the delivery domain with constraints. Let's parse the problem.
Domain: delivery
Types:
- cell: object
- locatable: object
- package: locatable
- truck: locatable
Predicates:
- at ?x1 - locatable ?x2 - cell
- carrying ?x1 - truck ?x2 - package
- empty ?x1 - truck
- adjacent ?x1 - cell ?x2 - cell
- last ?t - truck ?c - cell
Actions:
1. pick-package
Parameters: (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell)
Precondition: (at ?p ?x) & (at ?t ?x) & (empty ?t)
Effect: not (at ?p ?x); not (empty ?t); carrying ?t ?p
2. drop-package
Parameters: (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell)
Precondition: (at ?t ?x) & (carrying ?t ?p)
Effect: empty ?t; not (carrying ?t ?p); at ?p ?x
3. move
Parameters: (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell)
Precondition: (adjacent ?from ?to) & (at ?t ?from) & not (= ?from ?to)
Effect: not (at ?t ?from); at ?t ?to; last ?t ?from
Constraints:
- (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
Goal:
- (and (at p1 c_0_2) (at p2 c_0_2))
Initial:
- Packages:
p1 at c_2_0
p2 at c_2_1
- Truck:
t1 at c_0_1
empty t1
Adjacencies listed.
We need to move both packages to c_0_2. Also, at some point, t1 must be at c_0_0 (sometime constraint). The goal doesn't require t1 at any location.
We must also respect all invariants:
- A package cannot be at two cells simultaneously.
- A truck cannot be at two cells simultaneously.
- A truck cannot carry two packages simultaneously (empty predicate ensures only one at a time).
- A package cannot be at a cell and carried simultaneously
