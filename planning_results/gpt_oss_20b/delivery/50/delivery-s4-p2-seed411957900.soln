commentaryWe need to generate a plan for the delivery domain with constraints. Let's analyze the problem.
Objects:
- cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3,
c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3,
c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2, c_2_3,
c_3_0, c_3_1, c_3_2, c_3_3
- packages: p1, p2
- truck: t1
Initial facts:
- adjacency facts: many pairs (adjacent X Y). It's a 4x4 grid. We can assume adjacency is symmetric; but they list both directions? Let's check: (adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2) and also (adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1). Yes both directions are listed. So move action requires adjacent from to, and from != to. So adjacency is symmetric but they include both directions.
- at p2 c_0_3
- at t1 c_1_3
- at p1 c_2_1
- empty t1
Goal:
- at p1 c_2_2
- at p2 c_2_2
Constraints:
- (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
So we must have t1 at c_0_0 at some point during the plan (not necessarily at the end). That's the only constraint.
Thus plan must:
1. Move t1 from c_1_3 to c_0_0 at some point.
2. Deliver p1 to c_2_2.
3. Deliver p2 to c_2_2.
We need to pick routes.
Let's map grid coordinates: c_row_col.
c_0_0: row0 col0
c_0_1: row0 col1
c_0_2: row0 col2
c_0_3: row0 col3
c_1_0: row1 col0
c_1_1: row1 col1
c_1_2: row1 col2
c_1_3: row1 col3
c_2_0: row2 col0
c_2_
