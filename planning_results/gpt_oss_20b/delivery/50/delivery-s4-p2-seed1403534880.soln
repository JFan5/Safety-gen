commentaryWe need to generate a plan for delivery-4x4-2-1403534880.
Domain: delivery with trucks, packages, cells. Constraints: adjacency, move, pick-package, drop-package. Also PDDL3 constraint: (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_1) (at p2 c_0_1))
Constraint: t1 must be at c_0_0 at some time during the plan (sometime). So plan must include a move of t1 to c_0_0 at some point, or it could start there (it does start at c_0_0). Wait initial state: (at t1 c_0_0) and (empty t1). So t1 is already at c_0_0 initially. The constraint is "sometime (at t1 c_0_0)". Since it's already at c_0_0 initially, that satisfies the constraint immediately. However, we must be careful: if t1 leaves c_0_0 and never returns, the constraint would be violated. So we must ensure that t1 either stays at c_0_0 throughout, or returns to c_0_0 at some point. Since it's already there, we could just keep it there and never move it. But packages need to be moved. Packages p1 at c_3_0, p2 at c_1_1. Goal: both at c_0_1. So we need to move packages to c_0_1. That requires truck t1 to travel to locations to pick and drop packages. So t1 will leave c_0_0. Therefore we must plan a return to c_0_0 at some point before the end to satisfy the constraint. Alternatively, we could move t1 to c_0_1, pick both packages, and then drop them at c_0_1. But that would leave t1 at c_0_1, not c_0_0. So constraint violated. So we need to return t1 to c_0_0 after delivering packages. So plan: t1 moves from c_0_0 to somewhere to pick p2 at c_1_1, then to c_3_0 to pick p1, then to c_0_1 to drop both, then back to c_0_
