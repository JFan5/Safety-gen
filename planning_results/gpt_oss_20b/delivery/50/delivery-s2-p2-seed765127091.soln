commentary# Plan Generation for:
# Domain: delivery
# Problem: delivery-2x2-2-765127091
# Entities:
# Cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1
# Packages: p1, p2
# Truck: t1
# Initial State:
# adjacencies:
#   c_1_0 <-> c_0_0
#   c_1_0 <-> c_1_1
#   c_0_0 <-> c_0_1
#   c_1_1 <-> c_0_1
# (plus the symmetric relations as listed)
# locations:
#   t1 at c_1_0
#   p1 at c_1_1
#   p2 at c_1_1
#   t1 empty
# Goal:
#   p1 at c_1_0
#   p2 at c_1_0
# PDDL3 Constraints:
#   1. (sometime (at t1 c_0_0))
#      => t1 must be at c_0_0 at some point during the plan.
# Goal Analysis:
# Both packages need to move from c_1_1 to c_1_0.
# The truck starts at c_1_0, which is the destination for the packages.
# Therefore, the truck must first move to c_0_0 (to satisfy the PDDL3 constraint),
# then return to c_1_0 to pick up and deliver the packages.
# Path Considerations:
#   c_1_0 <-> c_0_0
#   c_1_0 <-> c_1_1
#   c_0_0 <-> c_0_1
#   c_0_1 <-> c_1_1
# Direct path from c_1_1 to c_1_0 exists: c_1_1 <-> c_1_0.
# However, since the truck starts at c_1_0, it must first go to c_0_0
#   (sometime constraint) and then back to c_1_0 before interacting with the packages.
# Action Requirements:
#   pick-package: truck, package, cell; preconditions: (at package cell)
