commentary# Plan Generation
# 1. Parse the PDDL3 constraint:
#    (:constraints (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)))
#    -> t1 must be at c_0_0 at least once during the plan.
# 2. Goal:
#    (and (at p1 c_1_0) (at p2 c_1_0))
# 3. Initial state:
#    p1 at c_0_1
#    p2 at c_0_2
#    t1 at c_1_2
#    t1 empty
#    adjacency list as provided.
# 4. Required actions:
#    - move truck t1 between adjacent cells.
#    - pick-package (truck, package, cell) when both at cell and truck empty.
#    - drop-package (truck, package, cell) when truck at cell and carrying package.
# 5. Strategy:
#    a) Transport t1 to c_0_0 to satisfy the "sometime" constraint.
#    b) From c_0_0, pick up p1 (currently at c_0_1) -> need to move to c_0_1 first.
#    c) Drop p1 at c_1_0.
#    d) Pick up p2 (currently at c_0_2) -> need to move to c_0_2 first.
#    e) Drop p2 at c_1_0.
#    f) Ensure t1 visits c_0_0 at least once (already satisfied before picking p1).
# 6. Path calculations:
#    - c_1_2 -> c_0_2 (adjacent)
#    - c_0_2 -> c_0_1 (adjacent)
#    - c_0_1 -> c_0_0 (adjacent)   # t1 visits c_0_0 here
#    - c_0_0 -> c_0_1 (adjacent)
#    - c_0_1 -> c_1_1 (adjacent)
#    - c_1_1 -> c_1_0 (adjacent)   # t1 reaches c_1_0 to drop p1
#    - c_1_0 -> c_2_0 (adjacent)
#    - c_2_0
