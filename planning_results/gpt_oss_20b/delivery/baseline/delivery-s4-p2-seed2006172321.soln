analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_3_0) (at p2 c_3_0)). So both packages must be at cell c_3_0.
Initial state: p2 at c_0_3, p1 at c_3_1, t1 at c_0_2, empty t1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0. Also we must satisfy that at the end, both packages at c_3_0.
We need to plan moves for truck t1 to move from c_0_2 to c_0_0 (via adjacent cells). Then pick up packages and deliver them to c_3_0.
We have adjacency list. Let's map adjacency graph.
Cells: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_0_2, c_0_3, c_1_0, c_1_1, c_1_2, c_1_3, c_2_0, c_2_1, c_2_2, c_2_3, c_3_0, c_3_1, c_3_2, c_3_3.
Adjacency pairs given. Let's list adjacency for each cell:
c_0_0 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_0, c_0_1? Wait we have adjacency c_0_0 c_0_1, c_0_0 c_1_0, c_0_0 c_0_1 again? duplicates. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 appears twice. Also c_0_0 c_1_0 appears. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 again. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 again. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 again. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 again. Also c_0_0 c_0_1 again. Also c_0
