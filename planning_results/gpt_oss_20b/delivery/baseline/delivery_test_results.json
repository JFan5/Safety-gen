Effect: not at t from, at t to, last t from.\nGoal: (and (at p1 c_1_3) (at p2 c_1_3)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_3.\nInitial state: at t1 c_0_1; at p2 c_2_1; at p1 c_3_3; empty t1. Also adjacency list.\nConstraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.\nWe need to deliver both packages to c_1_3. The truck starts at c_0_1. It can move to adjacent cells. We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_1_3.\nWe need to ensure that at some point t1 is at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0.\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions.\nLet's examine adjacency: adjacency list includes many pairs. Let's list adjacency for each cell:\nc_0_0 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_0, c_3_0? Wait adjacency list includes (adjacent c_3_0 c_2_0) etc. Let's parse.\nGiven adjacency list:\n- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2\n- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1\n- adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2\n- adjacent c_2_1 c",
