analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?p ?x, at ?t ?x, empty ?t. Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?t ?x, carrying ?t ?p. Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Problem: cells c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1. Packages p1, p2. Truck t1. Initial state: at t1 c_1_0. at p1 c_1_1. at p2 c_1_1. empty t1. Adjacent pairs: c_1_0 adjacent c_0_0; c_0_0 adjacent c_1_0; c_1_0 adjacent c_1_1; c_0_0 adjacent c_0_1; c_0_1 adjacent c_0_0; c_1_1 adjacent c_1_0; c_1_1 adjacent c_0_1; c_0_1 adjacent c_1_1. So adjacency is symmetrical.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_0) (at p2 c_1_0)). So both packages must be at c_1_0.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). So at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies the goal and constraint.
We need to consider that the truck starts at c_1_0. Packages at c_1_1. We need to move truck to c_0_
