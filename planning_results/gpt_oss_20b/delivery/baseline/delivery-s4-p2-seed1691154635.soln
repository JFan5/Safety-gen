analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_3_1) (at p2 c_3_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_3_1.
Initial state: at t1 c_0_1; at p2 c_1_0; at p1 c_3_1; empty t1. So p1 already at c_3_1. p2 at c_1_0. Need to move p2 to c_3_1.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 moves to c_0_0.
Also we must ensure that at the end, both packages at c_3_1. So we need to move p2 to c_3_1. We can pick p2, move truck to c_3_1, drop p2. But we must also satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to include a move to c_0_0 somewhere. We can move truck from c_0_1 to c_0_0, then later to c_3_1. But we must also ensure that at the end, t1 at c_3_1? Not required. Only
