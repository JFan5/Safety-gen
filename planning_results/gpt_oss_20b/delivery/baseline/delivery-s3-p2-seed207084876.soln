analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?p ?x, at ?t ?x, empty ?t. Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?t ?x, carrying ?t ?p. Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_0) (at p2 c_1_0)). So both packages must be at cell c_1_0.
Initial state: at p1 c_0_1, at p2 c_0_2, at t1 c_1_2, empty t1. Adjacent relationships given.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that moves t1 to c_0_0 at some point, and eventually deliver both packages to c_1_0.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_1_0. We can pick up packages, move truck, drop them.
We need to consider adjacency: Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
