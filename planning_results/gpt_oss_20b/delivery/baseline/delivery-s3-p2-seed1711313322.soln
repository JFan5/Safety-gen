analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move.
Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_2) (at p2 c_0_2)). So both packages at cell c_0_2.
Initial state: at p1 c_2_0, at p2 c_2_1, at t1 c_0_1, empty t1. Adjacent relationships given.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to produce a sequence of actions that moves t1 to c_0_0 at some point, and eventually deliver both packages to c_0_2.
We need to consider adjacency: adjacency list includes many pairs. Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_2 c_0_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c
