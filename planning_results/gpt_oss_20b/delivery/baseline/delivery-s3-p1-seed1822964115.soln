analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (at p1 c_1_0). Constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
Initial state: at p1 c_0_0, at t1 c_0_2, empty t1. Adjacent relations given.
We need to deliver p1 to c_1_0. So truck must move to c_1_0 carrying p1. But we need to satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to move truck to c_0_0 at some point. But initial at c_0_2. So we can move to c_0_0 via adjacent cells.
Let's examine adjacency: adjacency list includes many pairs. Let's list adjacency pairs:
adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
