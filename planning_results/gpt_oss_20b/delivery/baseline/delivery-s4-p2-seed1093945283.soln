analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at ?x1 - locatable ?x2 - cell; carrying ?t - truck ?p - package; empty ?t - truck; adjacent ?x1 - cell ?x2 - cell; last ?t - truck ?c - cell.
Actions:
pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (and (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t)). Effect: (not (at ?p ?x)), (not (empty ?t)), (carrying ?t ?p).
drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (and (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p)). Effect: (empty ?t), (not (carrying ?t ?p)), (at ?p ?x).
move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: (and (adjacent ?from ?to) (at ?t ?from) (not (= ?from ?to))). Effect: (not (at ?t ?from)), (at ?t ?to), (last ?t ?from).
Goal: (and (at p1 c_2_1) (at p2 c_2_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_2_1.
Initial state: at p2 c_1_1, at p1 c_1_1, at t1 c_0_3, empty t1. So both packages start at same cell c_1_1. The truck starts at c_0_3.
We need to move truck to c_2_1, pick up packages, deliver them to c_2_1. But we need to pick both packages. But the truck can carry only one package at a time? The carrying predicate indicates truck carrying a package. The empty predicate indicates truck empty. So truck can carry at most one package at a time. So we need to pick one package, drop it at destination, then pick the other, drop it.
But we also have constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). That means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_
