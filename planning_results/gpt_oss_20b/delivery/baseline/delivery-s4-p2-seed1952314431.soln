analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?p ?x) (at ?t ?x) (empty ?t). Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: (at ?t ?x) (carrying ?t ?p). Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_2_1) (at p2 c_2_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_2_1.
Initial state: at t1 c_2_2. at p2 c_3_2. at p1 c_1_0. empty t1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to move truck from c_2_2 to c_0_0 eventually, while picking up packages and dropping them at c_2_1.
We need to plan a sequence of moves and pick/drop actions.
We must ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_2_1. The truck can be anywhere at the end, but must satisfy constraint that at some point it was at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies all constraints.
We need to consider adjacency list: many adjacent pairs. Let's list adjacency for each cell:
Given adjacency list, we can deduce connectivity. Let's map adjacency:
- c_0_0 adjacent to c_0_1, c_1_0, c_3_0? Wait adjacency list includes (adjacent
