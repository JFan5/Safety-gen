analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (at p1 c_2_1). Initially at p1 c_1_1. Truck t1 at c_2_0, empty.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver package to c_2_1. So truck must pick up package at c_1_1, move to c_2_1, drop it.
But must also at some point be at c_0_0. So we need to route through that cell.
We need to ensure adjacency constraints: adjacency list given. Let's list adjacency pairs:
adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
adjacent c_0_0 c_1_0
adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_0 c_2_0
adjacent c_1_2 c_0_2
adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
adjacent c_0_1
