analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (at p1 c_1_1). Initially: at t1 c_0_2, at p1 c_0_1, empty t1. Adjacent relations given.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So plan must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to deliver package p1 to c_1_1. Initially at c_0_1. So we need to move truck to c_0_1, pick package, move to c_1_1, drop.
But we must also satisfy constraint: at some point t1 at c_0_0. So we need to include a step where t1 is at c_0_0. That could be before picking or after.
We must ensure that at the end, p1 at c_1_1. Also, we must maintain that at each step, preconditions hold.
Let's examine adjacency: Provided adjacency pairs. Let's list adjacency:
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
- adjacent c_
