analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Domain: delivery. We have one truck t1, one package p1. Goal: at p1 c_1_2. Initially at p1 c_2_0. Truck at c_0_0. We need to move truck to c_2_0, pick up package, then move to c_1_2, drop. But we must satisfy constraint: sometime (at t1 c_0_0). That means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. Initially it is at c_0_0, so constraint satisfied. So we don't need to return to c_0_0 later. But we must ensure that at some point it's at c_0_0. It's already at start. So plan can be simple.
We need to ensure that at each step, preconditions hold.
We have adjacency relations: we need to know adjacency list. Provided adjacency pairs. Let's list adjacency:
adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
adjacent c_1_2 c_2_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
adjacent c_0_0 c_1_0
adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_0 c_2_0
adjacent c_1_2 c_0_2
