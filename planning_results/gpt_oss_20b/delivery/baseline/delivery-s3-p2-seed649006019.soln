analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_0_1) (at p2 c_0_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_0_1.
Initial state: at t1 c_1_0; at p2 c_2_1; at p1 c_0_2; empty t1.
Adjacency: many pairs. We need to move truck t1 to deliver packages to c_0_1.
We need to pick up packages and drop them at c_0_1.
Constraints: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during the plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies this constraint.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages are at c_0_1. The truck can be anywhere.
We need to consider adjacency: we need to know adjacency pairs. Let's list adjacency pairs:
- adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0
- adjacent c_0_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_2_1
- adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
- adjacent c_1_2 c_1_1
- adjacent c_2_1 c_1_1
- adjacent c_1_0 c_1_1
- adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
- adjacent c_1_2 c_0_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_0_2 c_1_2
- adjacent c_2_2 c_2_1
- adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0
- adjacent c_0_2 c_0_1
- adjacent c_0_1 c_0_0
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_2
- adjacent c_1_1 c_1_0
