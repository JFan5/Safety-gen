analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery. Types: cell, locatable, package, truck. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Actions:
- pick-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?p ?x, at ?t ?x, empty ?t. Effect: not at ?p ?x, not empty ?t, carrying ?t ?p.
- drop-package: parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?x - cell). Preconditions: at ?t ?x, carrying ?t ?p. Effect: empty ?t, not carrying ?t ?p, at ?p ?x.
- move: parameters (?t - truck ?from - cell ?to - cell). Preconditions: adjacent ?from ?to, at ?t ?from, not (= ?from ?to). Effect: not at ?t ?from, at ?t ?to, last ?t ?from.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_2_1) (at p2 c_2_1)). So both packages must be at cell c_2_1.
Initial state: at t1 c_3_3; at p1 c_3_1; at p2 c3_3; empty t1. So truck at c3_3, packages at c3_1 and c3_3. Need to move both to c2_1.
Constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c0_0. So we must include a step where truck moves to c0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies this constraint. Also we must ensure that at the end, both packages at c2_1.
We need to consider adjacency list. Let's list adjacency pairs:
adjacent c_0_1 c_0_2
adjacent c_1_1 c_0_1
adjacent c_1_3 c_1_2
adjacent c_2_1 c_3_1
adjacent c_2_0 c_3_0
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_0
adjacent c_0_0 c_0_1
adjacent c_2_1 c_2_2
