analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the problem. Let's analyze the domain and problem.
Domain: delivery with actions pick-package, drop-package, move. Predicates: at, carrying, empty, adjacent, last.
Goal: (and (at p1 c_1_1) (at p2 c_1_1)). So both packages at cell c_1_1.
Initial state: p1 at c_0_1, p2 at c_1_0, t1 at c_2_0, empty t1.
Adjacency: many pairs. We need to move truck to pick up packages and drop them at c_1_1.
Also constraint: (sometime (at t1 c_0_0)). Means at some point during plan, t1 must be at c_0_0. So we must include a step where t1 is at c_0_0.
We need to produce a plan that satisfies that constraint.
We need to ensure that at the end, both packages at c_1_1. The truck can be anywhere.
We need to consider that pick-package requires at p at x, at t at x, empty t. So truck must be at same cell as package and empty.
Drop-package requires at t at x, carrying t p. So we can drop at any cell.
We need to move truck to c_0_0 at some point. So plan: move t1 from c_2_0 to c_0_0 via adjacency. Let's see adjacency list: adjacent c_2_0 c_2_1, adjacent c_2_0 c_1_0. So from c_2_0 to c_1_0 or c_2_1. To reach c_0_0, we need path: c_2_0 -> c_1_0 -> c_0_0. But adjacency c_1_0 adjacent to c_0_0? Yes, adjacent c_1_0 c_0_0. So path: move t1 from c_2_0 to c_1_0, then to c_0_0. That satisfies constraint.
Now we need to pick up packages. Let's plan:
1. Move t1 to c_1_0 (adjacent). Then pick up p2 at c_1_0. But pick-package requires empty t1. It's empty initially. So we can pick p2
