Let me first understand what the initial state and goal are.\nThe problem defines objects b1 to b6. The initial state has some blocks on tables or stacked. Let me list out the initial conditions:\n- arm-empty\n- on-table b1\n- on-table b2\n- on-table b3\n- on b4 b2 (so b4 is on top of b2)\n- on-table b5\n- on b6 b4 (so b6 is on top of b4)\n- clear b1\n- clear b3\n- clear b5\n- clear b6\nWait, the clear predicates are for b1, b3, b5, b6.

So we need to stack b1 on b2, b2 on b3, and b3 on b5.\nBut the constraints say: (sometime-before (on b2 b3) (on b1 b2)). So the action that causes (on b2 b3) must happen before the action that causes (on b1 b2). Wait, no—the constraint is that the event (on b2 b3) must happen sometime before (on b1 b2). Wait, in PDDL constraints, \"sometime-before\" means that the time when the constraint is satisfied (the effect) must occur before the other. So the action that results in (on b2 b3) must happen before the action that results in (on b1 b2).\nHmm, but in the problem, the goal is to have all three on relations. Let me think about the steps.\nFirst, let's visualize the initial state. The blocks on the table are b1, b2, b3, b5. Then b4 is on b2, and b6 is on b4. So the stack is b6 on b4 on b2. So the initial stack is b2 (with b4 on top of it, and b6 on top of b4).\nThe goal is to have b1 on b2, b2 on b3, and b3 on b5. So we need to build a stack of b1",

      "raw_solution": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to generate the plan for this Block World problem. Hmm, first I need to understand the problem setup.\nSo the domain is blocksworld with the given actions: pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. The problem is BW-rand-6. Let me look at the initial state and the goal.\nInitial state:\n- arm-empty\n- on b1 b3\n- on b2 b6\n- on-table b3\n- on-table b4\n- on b5 b4\n- on-table b6\n- clear b1\n- clear b2\n- clear b5\nGoal state:\n- (on b1 b2)\n- (on-table b2)\n- (on-table b3)\n- (on b4 b3)\n- (on b5 b1)\n- (on b6 b4)\nAlso, there's a constraint: (sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b2)). So the action that puts b2 on table must happen before the action that puts b1 on b2.\nWait, no—the constraint says \"sometime-before (on-table b2) (on b1 b2)\". So the event of b2 being on table must happen before the event of b1 being on b2. But in the goal, b1 is on b2, and b2 is on table. Wait, the goal has (on b1 b2) and (on-table b2). So b2 is on table, and b1 is on top of b2. So the constraint says that the time when b2 is placed on table must be before the time when b1 is placed on b2.\nBut in the initial state, b2 is on b6 (since on b2 b6), and b6 is on table. Wait, initial state: on b2 b6, on-table b6. So b2 is on b6, which is on table.\nWait, the problem is to get to the goal state where b1 is on b2 (so b2 is the bottom block), b2 is on table, b3 is on table, b4 is on b3, b5 is on b1, and b6 is on b4.\nLet me list the goal conditions:\n- on b1 b2 → b1 is on top of b2\n- on-table b2 → b2 is on table\n- on-table b",

Let me first understand the initial state and the goal.\nThe initial state has:\n- arm-empty\n- on b1 b5\n- on-table b2\n- on b3 b2\n- on b4 b1\n- on-table b5\n- clear b3\n- clear b4\nWait, the goal is to have:\n- (on b1 b2)\n- (on b3 b4)\n- (on b4 b1)\n- (on b5 b3)\nAlso, there's a constraint: (sometime-before (on b3 b4) (on b1 b2)). So the action that causes (on b3 b4) must happen before the action that causes (on b1 b2).\nHmm, first I need to see what the current setup is. Let's list the blocks and their positions.\nBlocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5.\nInitial positions:\n- b1 is on b5 (so b5 is under b1)\n- b2 is on table\n- b3 is on b2\n- b4 is on b1\n- b5 is on table\nClear blocks: b3 and b4 are clear (so they're not on anything else, which makes sense since they're on the table or other blocks).\nWait, the initial state says (on b1 b5), so b1 is on top of b5. Then (on b4 b1), so b4 is on top of b1. And (on b3 b2), so b3 is on top of b2. Also, b2 and b5 are on the table.\nThe goal is to have:\n- b1 on b2\n- b3 on b4\n- b4 on b1\n- b5 on b3\nSo the desired stack is b5 -> b3 -> b4 -> b1 -> b2? Wait, no. Let's see:\nThe goal has (on b1 b2), (on b3 b4), (on b4 b1), (on b5 b3). So each block is on top of another. So the structure would be:\nb5 is on b3, b3 is on b4, b4 is on b",
