You are a planning expert. Your task is to generate a **valid plan** for the given domain and problem.

DOMAIN:
{domain_content}

PROBLEM:
{problem_content}

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- STRICTLY VERIFY: Do not generate an action unless its preconditions are explicitly satisfied by the state resulting from the previous steps.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
