ICCPS Safety Generalization LaTeX package
=======================================

This repository now holds only the artefacts required to build the
`sample-acmcp` manuscript. Everything else from the original ACM
bundle has been removed to keep the project lightweight. All files now
live in the repository root:

- `sample-acmcp.tex`: main manuscript source
- `sample-base.bib`: bibliography database
- `acmart.cls`: ACM class used by the manuscript
- `ACM-Reference-Format.bst`: bibliography style
- `acm-jdslogo.png`: logo referenced by the class

Build:
1. Ensure a recent TeX Live/MacTeX distribution is available.
2. Run `make` (or `make all`) from the repository root to generate
   `sample-acmcp.pdf`.
3. Use `make clean` to drop intermediate files, or `make distclean` to
   remove the PDF as well.

You can also compile manually:

```
pdflatex sample-acmcp.tex
bibtex sample-acmcp
pdflatex sample-acmcp.tex
pdflatex sample-acmcp.tex
```

The resulting PDF is written to `sample-acmcp.pdf`.
