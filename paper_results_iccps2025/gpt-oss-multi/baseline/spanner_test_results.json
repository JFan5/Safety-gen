Let's analyze domain and problem.\nDomain: spanner domain with actions: walk, pickup_spanner, tighten_nut.\nPredicates: at, carrying, useable, link, tightened, loose.\nObjects: bob (man), spanner1-4, nut1-3, location1-4, shed, gate.\nInitial state: bob at shed. spanner1 at location2, useable spanner1. spanner2 at location3, useable spanner2. spanner3 at location1, useable spanner3. spanner4 at location1, useable spanner4. All nuts loose at gate. Links: shed-location1, location4-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3, location3-location4.\nGoal: all nuts tightened.\nConstraints: sometime-before (tightened nut1) (tightened nut2). So nut1 must be tightened before nut2. Also at-most-once (at bob shed). Means bob can be at shed at most once. Since bob starts at shed, he cannot return to shed again. So he must leave shed and never return.\nWe need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.\nWe need to consider that bob must walk to locations to tighten nuts. He needs spanner to tighten nuts. Spanner must be useable. Useable spanner is initially useable. After tightening, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used only once. But we have 4 spanners. We need to tighten 3 nuts. So we can use 3 spanners. But we must ensure that each spanner is useable at the time of tightening. After use, useable becomes false. So we need to pick spanners accordingly.\nAlso, bob cannot return to shed. So he must leave shed and not come back. He can walk to other locations via links.\nWe need to plan path: bob at shed. He can walk to location1 via link shed-location1. Then from location1 to location2, location3, location4, gate. Nuts are at gate. So bob must walk to gate to tighten nuts. He can pick up spanner at location1 or location2 or location3. Spanners at location1: spanner3 and spanner4. At location2: spanner1. At location3: spanner2.

So after leaving shed, cannot return to shed.\nWe need to produce a plan that satisfies constraints.\nWe have 3 locations: location1, location2, location3, plus shed and gate. Links: shed-location1, location3-gate, location1-location2, location2-location3. So path: shed -> location1 -> location2 -> location3 -> gate. Also location3-gate link. So to get to nuts at gate, Bob must walk from shed to location1 to location2 to location3 to gate. He can walk along links.\nSpanners: spanner1 at location3, spanner2 at location2. Both useable.\nNuts: nut1 at gate, loose; nut2 at gate, loose.\nGoal: tighten both nuts. Must tighten nut1 before nut2.\nWe need to pick spanner to tighten nuts. Use spanner1 or spanner2. Useable spanner must be used to tighten. After use, useable becomes false. So we need to use both spanners? Actually we can use spanner1 to tighten nut1, then spanner2 to tighten nut2. But spanner1 is at location3, spanner2 at location2. Bob must pick up spanner at",

He needs a spanner at gate. He can pick up spanner at location1 or location4 and bring to gate. But spanner must be useable. Useable spanner1,2,3,4. After use, useable becomes false. So each spanner can be used once. We need to tighten all three nuts. We have 4 spanners. So we can use spanner1,2,3,4 each once. But we need to satisfy constraint: nut1 tightened before nut2.
