Based on the provided domain and problem, and following the rules you've outlined, here's the plan:

```
(sail l3 l1)
(board c0 l3)
(board c1 l1)
(board c2 l3)
(sail l1 l3)
```

This plan will move the ferry from location `l1` to `l3`, board the cars `c0`, `c1`, and `c2` on the ferry at their respective current locations, and then move the ferry back to location `l3` to achieve the goal state.
