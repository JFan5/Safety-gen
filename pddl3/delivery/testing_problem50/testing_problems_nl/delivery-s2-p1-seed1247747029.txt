## Domain / Scenario
Domain: delivery

## Objects
Cell: c_0_0, c_0_1, c_1_0, c_1_1
Package: p1
Truck: t1

## Initial State
- Cell c_0_0 is adjacent to cell c_1_0.
- Cell c_1_1 is adjacent to cell c_0_1.
- Cell c_0_0 is adjacent to cell c_0_1.
- Cell c_1_0 is adjacent to cell c_1_1.
- T1 is at cell c_1_1.
- P1 is at cell c_0_1.
- Truck t1 is empty.

## Goal
All of the following must be true:
  - P1 is at cell c_1_0.

## Constraints
- At all times during the plan, it is not the case that truck t1 was last at cell c_0_0 and t1 is at cell c_0_1 and it is not the case that truck t1 was last at cell c_0_1 and t1 is at cell c_0_0 must hold.
