- L1 and l0 are different locations.
- L0 and l2 are different locations.
- L2 and l0 are different locations.
- L0 and l3 are different locations.
- L3 and l0 are different locations.
- L0 and l4 are different locations.
- L4 and l0 are different locations.
- L1 and l2 are different locations.
- L2 and l1 are different locations.
