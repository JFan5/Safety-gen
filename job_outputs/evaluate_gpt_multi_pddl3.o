The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-unsloth-bnb-4bit does not have a padding token! Will use pad_token = <|reserved_200017|>.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.

- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:

- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:

- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:

- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

### Output Requirements:

- Each line must follow the format:

- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
