</PROBLEM>

## Step 1: Plan for communicating soil data from waypoint7 to general
To communicate soil data from waypoint7 to general, we need to use the lander at waypoint7 and the rover at waypoint8. We can then use the communicate_soil_data action to send the data from the rover to the lander, which is available at general.

## Step 2: Plan for equipping the rover for imaging
Since we are going to take an image, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for imaging. We can use the calibrate action to calibrate the camera on the rover.

## Step 3: Plan for calibrating the camera
To calibrate the camera, we need to use the calibration_target action to calibrate the camera with the objective3.

## Step 4: Plan for taking the image
With the camera calibrated, we can now take the image using the take_image action.

## Step 5: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general
After taking the image, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.

## Step 6: Plan for communicating rock data from waypoint6 to general
To communicate rock data from waypoint6 to general, we need to use the lander at waypoint6 and the rover at waypoint7. We can then use the communicate_rock_data action to send the data from the rover to the lander, which is available at general.

## Step 7: Plan for equipping the rover for soil analysis
Since we are going to analyze the soil, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for soil analysis. We can use the equipped_for_soil_analysis action to check if the rover is equipped for soil analysis.

## Step 8: Plan for equipping the rover for communication
Since we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication. We can use the equipped_for_imaging action to check if the rover is equipped for communication.

## Step 9: Plan for calibrating the camera again
Since we are going to take another image, we need to calibrate the camera again using the calibration_target action.

## Step 10: Plan for taking the image again
With the camera calibrated, we can now take the image again using the take_image action.

## Step 11: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general again
After taking the image again, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.

## Step 12: Plan for equipping the rover for soil analysis again
Since we are going to analyze the soil again, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for soil analysis again.

## Step 13: Plan for equipping the rover for communication again
Since we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication again.

## Step 14: Plan for calibrating the camera again
Since we are going to take another image, we need to calibrate the camera again using the calibration_target action.

## Step 15: Plan for taking the image again
With the camera calibrated, we can now take the image again using the take_image action.

## Step 16: Plan for communicating the image data from objective3 to general again
After taking the image again, we need to communicate the image data from objective3 to general.

## Step 17: Plan for equipping the rover for communication again
Since we are going to communicate the data from the rover to the lander, we need to ensure that the rover is equipped for communication again.

## Step 18: Plan for communicating the image data

You are a domain-agnostic planning engine. Produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input below.

<DOMAIN>

(define (problem roverprob13) (:domain Rover)
...
(:goal (and
(communicated_rock_data waypoint1)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)
))
)

</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

Since the goal is to communicate rock data from waypoint1 and image data from objective0, low_res, the plan must include actions that satisfy these conditions. The plan can be constructed as follows:

1. Traverse from rover0 to waypoint1.
2. Sample rock data from waypoint1.
3. Communicate rock data from waypoint1.
4. Traverse from rover0 to waypoint1.
5. Sample image data from objective0, low_res.
6. Communicate image data from objective0, low_res.

The final output is:

(traverse rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_rock rover0 waypoint1)
(communicated_rock_data waypoint1)
(traverse rover0 waypoint1)
(sample_image rover0 objective0)
(communicated_image_data objective0 low_res)

</PROBLEM>

## Step 1: Analyze the problem and identify the goal
The goal is to communicate the image data from objective0 to the lander general using a camera. The camera is calibrated for low-res mode, and the rover is available at waypoint4.

## Step 2: Plan the sequence of actions
1. Move the rover to waypoint7.
2. Take an image using camera1 and objective2 at waypoint7.
3. Communicate the image data from the lander general.

## Step 3: Validate the plan
- The rover is available at waypoint4, and we can move it to waypoint7.
- The camera is calibrated for low-res mode, and we have an objective (objective2) at waypoint7.
- We can communicate the image data from the lander general.

The final answer is:

(move rover0 waypoint7)
(take_image camera1 objective2 waypoint7)
(communicate_image_data general camera1 waypoint7)

</PROBLEM>

## Step 1: Analyze the problem and identify the goal
The goal is to produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input domain and problem.

## Step 2: Identify the constraints and requirements
The constraints include the requirement that the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), and the objective is to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.

## Step 3: Plan the actions
The first step is to move the rover from waypoint 0 to waypoint 4, and then from waypoint 4 to waypoint 0. This is because the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints, and the objective is to produce a plan that satisfies these constraints.

## Step 4: Validate the plan
The plan is valid because it only uses available symbols, respects the typing, and satisfies all constraints and requirements.

## Step 5: Produce the final output
The final output is the plan, which consists of the following steps:
- (navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
- (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)

The final answer is: 
1. (navigate rover0 waypoint0 waypoint4)
2. (navigate rover0 waypoint4 waypoint0)

</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

## Step 1: Plan for Communicating Soil Data
To communicate soil data from waypoint6 to the lander, we need to move the rover from waypoint6 to the lander.

## Step 2: Plan for Communicating Image Data
To communicate the image data, we need to move the rover from waypoint7 to the lander.

## Step 3: Plan for Moving to Waypoint7
To move the rover from waypoint6 to waypoint7, we need to traverse from waypoint6 to waypoint7.

## Step 4: Plan for Moving to Waypoint4
To move the rover from waypoint7 to waypoint4, we need to traverse from waypoint7 to waypoint4.

## Step 5: Plan for Moving to Waypoint1
To move the rover from waypoint4 to waypoint1, we need to traverse from waypoint4 to waypoint1.

## Step 6: Plan for Moving to Waypoint0
To move the rover from waypoint1 to waypoint0, we need to traverse from waypoint1 to waypoint0.

## Step 7: Plan for Communicating Soil Data (Again)
To communicate soil data from waypoint0 to the lander, we need to move the rover from waypoint0 to the lander.

## Step 8: Plan for Moving to Waypoint3
To move the rover from waypoint0 to waypoint3, we need to traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint3.

## Step 9: Plan for Moving to Waypoint5
To move the rover from waypoint3 to waypoint5, we need to traverse from waypoint3 to waypoint5.

## Step 10: Plan for Moving to Waypoint4 (Again)
To move the rover from waypoint5 to waypoint4, we need to traverse from waypoint5 to waypoint4.

## Step 11: Plan for Moving to Waypoint7 (Again)
To move the rover from waypoint4 to waypoint7, we need to traverse from waypoint4 to waypoint7.

## Step 12: Plan for Moving to Waypoint6 (Again)
To move the rover from waypoint7 to waypoint6, we need to traverse from waypoint7 to waypoint6.

## Step 13: Plan for Communicating Image Data (Again)
To communicate the image data, we need to move the rover from waypoint6 to the lander.

## Step 14: Finalize the Plan
All the steps are now complete.

)

</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`.

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a)

You are a domain-agnostic planning engine. Produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input below.

<DOMAIN>

LLM output: <DOMAIN>
...</DOMAIN>

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

You are a domain-agnostic planning engine. Produce a valid, grounded, totally-ordered plan for the input below.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)

Now produce the final output.

<PROBLEM>
...</PROBLEM>

## Planning Rules
1) Only use available symbols:
   - objects declared under PROBLEM :objects, and
   - constants declared under DOMAIN/PROBLEM :constants (if any).
   Do not invent new objects or predicates. Respect :typing; each action argument must match its declared type.

2) Constraints:
   - If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3/PDDL 3.0 constraints (e.g., under :constraints or equivalent), EVERY such constraint MUST be satisfied.
   - If no constraints are provided in the PROBLEM, solve as a goal-directed PDDL2 task.

3) Plan form:
   - Produce a **sequential (totally-ordered), grounded** plan: no variables, no timestamps, no durations.

4) Internal validation before emitting (do not include reasoning in the output):
   - At each step, all action preconditions hold in the current state.
   - Never violate invariants or safety constraints implied by DOMAIN/PROBLEM.
   - If constraints exist in PROBLEM, ensure the plan satisfies all of them.

## Output Requirements
- Return **ONLY** the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must be exactly: `(<action-name> <obj1> <obj2>...)`
- Use action and object names **exactly** as written in the domain/problem (preserve original spelling/casing, including hyphens/underscores).
- No numbering, timestamps, costs, comments, headers, code fences, or extra text.
- If the initial state already satisfies all goals and all constraints (if any), output **nothing** (i.e., zero lines).
- If the task is unsatisfiable given the DOMAIN and PROBLEM (including any constraints), output **exactly one** line: `(NO-PLAN)`

## Examples
Bad:
- Plan:
- Here is the plan:
- (move a b)  (two actions on one line)
- (move a) extra

Good:
(move a b)
(pick a c)
(drop a d)
