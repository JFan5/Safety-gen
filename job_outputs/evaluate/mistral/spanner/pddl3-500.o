Unsloth 2025.11.3 patched 32 layers with 0 QKV layers, 0 O layers and 0 MLP layers.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
🦥 Unsloth: Will patch your computer to enable 2x faster free finetuning.
🦥 Unsloth Zoo will now patch everything to make training faster!

- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
