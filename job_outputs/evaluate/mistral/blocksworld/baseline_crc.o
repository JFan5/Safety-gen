  (:predicates (clear ?x)
               (on-table ?x)

PROBLEM:

(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 )
(:init
(arm-empty)

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
