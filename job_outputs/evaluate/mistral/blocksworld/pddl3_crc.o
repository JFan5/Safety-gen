Skipping import of cpp extensions due to incompatible torch version 2.8.0+cu128 for torchao version 0.14.1             Please see https://github.com/pytorch/ao/issues/2919 for more info
Unsloth 2025.8.6 patched 32 layers with 0 QKV layers, 0 O layers and 0 MLP layers.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
🦥 Unsloth: Will patch your computer to enable 2x faster free finetuning.
🦥 Unsloth Zoo will now patch everything to make training faster!
