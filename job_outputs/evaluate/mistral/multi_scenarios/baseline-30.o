- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

You are a planning expert. Your task is to generate a **valid plan** for the given domain and problem.

DOMAIN:
(define (domain gripper-strips)
 (:requirements :strips :typing :constraints) 
 (:types room object robot gripper)
 (:predicates (at-robby ?r - robot ?x - room)
 	      (at ?o - object ?x - room)
	      (free ?r - robot ?g - gripper)
	      (carry ?r - robot ?o - object ?g - gripper))

   (:action move
       :parameters  (?r - robot ?from ?to - room)
       :precondition (and  (at-robby ?r ?from))
       :effect (and  (at-robby ?r ?to)
		     (not (at-robby ?r ?from))))

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
