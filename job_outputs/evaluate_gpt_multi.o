### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. The goal: communicate soil data at waypoint2,8,4; communicate rock data at waypoint0,1,11,9; communicate image data objective3 high_res and objective1 low_res. Constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We must ensure all preconditions satisfied. We can choose any plan that works.

We need to consider the actions available: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint8 initially, rover1 at waypoint11. They have stores: rover0store, rover1store. They are equipped for soil analysis, imaging, etc. Rover1 also equipped for rock analysis.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 2,8,4. They are at those waypoints initially? Let's check init: at_soil_sample waypoint0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9. So soil samples at those waypoints. For waypoint2, we need to communicate soil data. So we need to sample soil at waypoint2, then communicate. Similarly for 8 and 4.

Also rock samples at 0,1,9,11. They are at those waypoints initially. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints and communicate.

Also need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective1 low_res. We need to calibrate cameras and take images.

We need to ensure that after sampling, we drop the sample into store, then communicate.

We need to ensure that the rovers can traverse to those waypoints. They have can_traverse edges. We need to navigate accordingly.

We need to ensure that the rovers are available and channel_free for communication.

We need to ensure that the constraints: rovers cannot be at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously. Initially rover0 at 8, rover1 at 11. So fine.

We need to produce a plan. Let's design a plan.

We have two rovers. Let's decide to use rover0 to handle soil samples at 2,8,4. Rover1 to handle rock samples at 0,1,9,11 and image

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover0 waypoint1). That means at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint0 before it is at waypoint1. So the plan must include visiting waypoint0 before waypoint1.

We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint3. We have visible relations. We need to get soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint3? Wait initial state: at_soil_sample waypoint2, at_rock_sample waypoint2, at_soil_sample waypoint3, at_rock_sample waypoint5, at_rock_sample waypoint7, at_rock_sample waypoint8. So soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint3. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and waypoint2. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints, then communicate.

We also need to capture images for objectives 2,1,3 with specified modes. We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res. camera2 supports colour, high_res, low_res. Calibration targets: camera0 -> objective3, camera1 -> objective0, camera2 -> objective0. So camera0 calibrates objective3. camera1 calibrates objective0. camera2 calibrates objective0. But we need images for objective2, objective1, objective3. We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. But camera0 calibrates objective3, camera1 objective0, camera2 objective0. None calibrate objective2 or objective1. But we can still take images with any camera? The calibrate action requires calibration_target camera i t. So only camera0 can calibrate objective3. But we need images for objective2 and objective1. We can still take images without calibration? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera for each objective. But we don't have calibration targets for objective2 or objective1. So maybe we can use camera2? It supports colour, high_res, low_res. But calibration_target only for camera2 is objective0. So cannot calibrate objective2 or objective1. So maybe we need to use camera0 for objective3 only. But we need images for objective2

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_image_data objective3 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint2 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint2 before it is at waypoint8. So we need to schedule visits accordingly.

We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

Goal: communicate image data for objective3 high_res, objective1 high_res, objective3 low_res. So we need to take images for those objectives and then communicate them.

We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res. camera2 supports colour and high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective0, camera1 objective0, camera2 objective1. So camera2 is calibrated for objective1. camera0 and camera1 for objective0. But we need images for objective3 and objective1. Wait objective3 is visible from many waypoints: 0,1,2,4,7,8,9,11. So we need to take images for objective3 high_res and low_res. But camera0 supports high_res and low_res. So we can use camera0 to take images for objective3. But camera0 is calibrated for objective0, not objective3. Calibration target is camera0 objective0. But we can calibrate camera0 for objective0 only. But we need to take images for objective3. The calibrate action requires calibration_target camera0 objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera0 for objective3. But we can calibrate camera0 for objective0 only. But we need to take images for objective3. But the calibrate action only allows calibrating for the target objective. So we cannot calibrate camera0 for objective3. But we can use camera2? camera2 supports high_res and colour. But camera2 is calibrated for objective1. So we can take images for objective1 with camera2. But we need objective3 images. We could use camera1? camera1 supports high_res. But camera

"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res, objective0 high_res, objective1 colour. So we need to take images of these objectives with appropriate modes and communicate them via lander general.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint6, rover1 at waypoint9. They have cameras: camera0 on rover1, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective3, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective2. They support modes: camera0 supports high_res, low_res; camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res; camera2 supports colour, low_res.

We need to capture images of objective3 with colour mode, objective1 with low_res and colour, objective0 with high_res. We need to communicate these images via lander general. The lander is at waypoint4. The visible relationships: visible_from objective0 includes waypoint0,2,5,7,10,11. visible_from objective1 includes waypoint3,6. visible_from objective2 includes waypoint0. visible_from objective3 includes waypoint1,3,6,8,9,10.

We need to have rovers at positions that can see the objectives. For each objective, we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from that objective. For objective3, visible_from includes waypoint1,3,6,8,9,10. For objective1, visible_from includes waypoint3,6. For objective0, visible_from includes waypoint0,2,5,7,10,11.

We also need to have cameras calibrated for the objective. Calibration requires that the rover is at a waypoint that is visible_from the objective and the camera is on board and calibration_target matches. The calibrate action: preconditions: equipped_for_imaging, calibration_target, at rover at waypoint, visible_from objective at that waypoint, on_board camera. So we need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. For camera0 and camera1, target is objective3. For camera2, target is objective2. But we don't need objective2 images. So we can ignore camera2.

We need to take images with camera1 (supports colour, high_res, low_res). For objective3, we need colour mode. camera1 supports colour. So we can calibrate camera1 for objective3, then take image with colour mode

- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint1, communicated_image_data objective1 colour, communicated_image_data objective2 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6). That means at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint6. So the plan must include that ordering.

We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. So at start, at waypoint5. We need to eventually be at waypoint6. So we need to navigate from 5 to 6. But we also need to sample soil at waypoint1, sample rock at some points, etc. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint1. That requires have_soil_analysis at waypoint1. So we need to sample soil at waypoint1. The sample_soil action requires at rover at waypoint1, at_soil_sample at waypoint1, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store_of store, empty store. Initially, store empty. So we can sample soil at waypoint1. Then we need to communicate soil data to lander general. The communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint x, at_lander at y, have_soil_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. Initially channel_free general. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. General at waypoint4. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint4. Many visible pairs. For example, visible waypoint4 to waypoint3, etc. We can navigate to waypoint4 or any visible. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at waypoint5 before at waypoint6. So we need to navigate from 5 to 6 eventually. We can navigate to 4 then to 6. But we need to be at waypoint4 to communicate? Actually we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. Let's check visible pairs: visible waypoint4 to waypoint3, visible waypoint4 to waypoint1, visible waypoint4 to waypoint2, visible waypoint4 to waypoint5, visible waypoint4 to waypoint6. So we can be at waypoint4 or 3 or 1 or 2 or 5 or 6. But we need to be at a waypoint visible to general. So we can navigate to waypoint4. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at waypoint5 before at waypoint6. So we can navigate from 5 to 4 to 6. That satisfies ordering

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint4, communicated_rock_data waypoint4, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must be at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint4? Wait "sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint4)" means that the state (at rover0 waypoint5) must occur before (at rover0 waypoint4). So the rover must visit waypoint5 before waypoint4. But the goal requires communicated_soil_data waypoint4 and communicated_rock_data waypoint4, which require the rover to be at waypoint4 to communicate. So the rover must go to waypoint5 first, then to waypoint4. Also need to collect soil samples at waypoint3 and 4? Actually soil samples at waypoint2,3,4. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and 4. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints, then communicate. Also rock sample at waypoint4. So we need to sample rock at waypoint4. Also need to take image of objective1 high_res. The objective1 visible_from waypoint0,2,4. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective1. We can take image from any waypoint that can see objective1. We need to calibrate camera0 to objective1. The camera0 is on board. Calibration target camera0 objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that can see objective1. Then take image high_res. Then communicate image data.

We also need to ensure that the rover is at waypoint5 before waypoint4. So plan: start at waypoint4. We need to go to waypoint5 first. So we can navigate from waypoint4 to waypoint5. Then from waypoint5 to waypoint4. But we also need to sample soil at waypoint3 and 4. We can sample soil at waypoint3 while at waypoint3. But we need to be at waypoint3. We can navigate from waypoint4 to waypoint3? Wait we start at waypoint4. We can navigate to waypoint3? There is can_traverse from waypoint4 to waypoint3? Yes, can_traverse rover0 waypoint4 waypoint3. So we can navigate to waypoint3. But we need to go to waypoint5 first before waypoint4. So we need to go to waypoint5, then back to

- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint11, 0, 4; communicated_image_data objective3 colour, objective1 low_res. Also constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint1 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So order: at waypoint1 before at waypoint8. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint1. So constraint satisfied if we never go to waypoint8 before returning to waypoint1? Wait we start at waypoint1. So we need to ensure we don't go to waypoint8 before we are at waypoint1 again? But we start at waypoint1, so constraint satisfied. But if we go to waypoint8 later, we must have visited waypoint1 earlier. That's fine.

Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint11, 0, 4. We have soil samples at waypoint0,4,10,11. We need to sample soil at those waypoints and communicate. Also need to communicate image data for objective3 colour and objective1 low_res. We have cameras: camera0 supports low_res, camera1 supports colour, camera2 supports colour and high_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective3, camera1 objective2, camera2 objective3. So to take image for objective3 colour, we need camera2 (supports colour) or camera1? camera1 supports colour but calibration target is objective2. So camera1 cannot take image for objective3. camera2 supports colour and calibration target objective3. So we need to calibrate camera2 at objective3, then take image at some waypoint visible from objective3. visible_from objective3: waypoint10,11. So we need to be at waypoint10 or 11 to take image. Also need to have camera2 on board, calibrated. So plan: navigate to waypoint10, calibrate camera2 at objective3, take image at waypoint10 with camera2, objective3, colour. That yields have_image for objective3 colour. Then communicate image data for objective3 colour. Similarly for objective1 low_res: camera0 supports low_res, calibration target objective3. Wait camera0 calibration target is objective3, not objective1. So cannot calibrate camera0 for objective1. But camera1 supports colour, calibration target objective2. So cannot calibrate for objective1. But we need image data for objective1 low_res. We need a camera that supports

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. The goal: communicate soil data for waypoint2,7,0; communicate rock data for waypoint10,11,9; communicate image data for objective2 colour, low_res, and objective0 colour.

We need to produce a plan that satisfies these goals while respecting constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We need to ensure all preconditions hold at each step.

We need to consider the actions available: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint10 initially, rover1 at waypoint9. They have stores: rover0store, rover1store. They are equipped for soil, rock, imaging. They have cameras on board: camera0, camera1, camera2 on rover0; camera3 on rover1. Each camera has calibration targets: camera0 -> objective0, camera1 -> objective3, camera2 -> objective0, camera3 -> objective1. They support various modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res, low_res; camera1 supports low_res; camera2 supports colour; camera3 supports colour.

We need to get soil samples at waypoint2,7,0. They are at those waypoints initially? Let's check init: at_soil_sample waypoint0, waypoint2, waypoint4, waypoint6, waypoint7. So soil samples at 0,2,4,6,7. We need to communicate soil data for waypoint2,7,0. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints and then communicate.

We also need rock samples at waypoint10,11,9. They are at rock samples at waypoint8,9,10,11. So rock samples at 8,9,10,11. We need to communicate rock data for 10,11,9. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.

We also need to take images for objective2 colour, low_res, and objective0 colour. We need to calibrate cameras for those objectives and then take images.

We need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint3,2,7,9 and communicated_image_data for objective1,2,3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover0 must visit waypoint4 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint0). So at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint4 before it is at waypoint0. So the plan must include that ordering.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal. We must consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint10. We have visible relations, can_traverse edges. We need to navigate to waypoints with samples to collect soil and rock data, then communicate to lander general at waypoint8. Also need to take images for objectives 1,2,3 low_res. We have cameras 0,1,2 with calibration targets: camera0 -> objective0, camera1 -> objective1, camera2 -> objective1. But we need images for objective1,2,3. We have camera0 supports colour, high_res, low_res. camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res. camera2 supports low_res only. So to get images for objective1,2,3 low_res, we can use camera0 or camera1 or camera2. But camera2 only supports low_res. So we can use camera0 or camera1 for low_res images for objective1,2,3. But camera0 calibration target is objective0, not objective1. So camera0 cannot take image for objective1? Wait calibration target indicates which objective the camera is calibrated for. For camera0, calibration_target camera0 objective0. So camera0 can only take images for objective0? But the take_image action requires calibrated camera i for rover r. So we need to calibrate camera for each objective. For objective1, we need camera1 or camera2. camera1 calibration target is objective1. Good. camera2 calibration target is objective1 too. So we can use camera1 to take image for objective1. For objective2 and objective3, we need camera0? But camera0 calibration target is objective0. So camera0 cannot take image for objective2 or 3. But camera1 supports low_res and is calibrated for objective1. camera2 supports low_res and is calibrated for objective1. So we

- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.

- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, etc. We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data at waypoint6 and waypoint3, communicated_rock_data at waypoint11,4,1,8, communicated_image_data objective3 high_res, objective2 colour.

We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint1 simultaneously, never both at waypoint8 simultaneously.

We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold.

We need to use only objects defined.

We need to produce a plan that is valid. We don't need to optimize, just produce any plan that achieves the goal.

We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint4, rover1 at waypoint1. There are samples at various waypoints: at rock samples at 1,3,4,7,8,10,11; soil samples at 3,6,9,11. We need to collect soil data at waypoint6 and 3. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. For rock data at 11,4,1,8. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints. Also need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective2 colour. We have cameras: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1, camera2 on rover0. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective0, camera2 -> objective2. They support certain modes: camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports colour and high_res, camera2 supports high_res. We need to take images for objective3 high_res and objective2 colour. Wait objective2 is target of camera2, which supports high_res. But we need objective2 colour. But camera2 supports high_res only. So we cannot take colour image with camera2. But we need objective2 colour. But we could use camera0 or camera1 to take colour image of objective2. But camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports colour. So we can use camera0 or camera1 to take image of objective2 in colour mode. But we need to calibrate camera to objective2. Calibration target for camera0 is objective1,

Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint1 simultaneously.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint1 respectively. They have equipment: rover0 equipped for imaging, rover1 equipped for rock analysis and imaging. They have stores empty.

Goal: need to communicate rock data for waypoint8 and waypoint9. That requires have_rock_analysis at those waypoints, then communicate_rock_data action. Also need to communicate image data for objective0 and objective3 high_res. That requires have_image for those objectives with high_res mode.

We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_rock, sample_soil, calibrate, take_image, communicate_*.

We need to ensure that at each step preconditions hold.

We need to produce a valid plan. We can choose a simple plan: rover0 collects rock samples at waypoint8 and 9, then communicates. Also rover0 or rover1 takes images for objective0 and objective3.

But we must consider that objective0 visible_from waypoint0,1,2,5,9,11. So to take image for objective0, we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. For objective3 visible_from waypoint0. So we need to be at waypoint0 to take image for objective3. For objective0 we can be at any visible waypoint.

Also we need to calibrate camera before taking image. We have cameras on rovers: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. They have calibration targets: camera0 and camera1 target objective3, camera2 target objective3. So all cameras target objective3. But we need images for objective0 and objective3. So we need to calibrate camera for objective0? Wait calibration_target is only for objective3. So cameras cannot be calibrated for objective0. But we can still take image for objective0? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r) and (on_board ?i ?r) and (supports ?i ?m) and (visible_from ?o ?p) and (at ?r ?p). So we need calibrated camera for the rover. But calibration is only for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_rock_data waypoint11, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint6). That means rover0 must visit waypoint5 before waypoint6. Also must satisfy all preconditions.

We need to produce a sequence of actions. We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. It can traverse to many waypoints. We need to collect soil and rock samples at waypoints with samples. Then communicate data to lander general at waypoint2. The lander is at waypoint2. The rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander to communicate. The visible relations are given. We need to ensure that at the time of communication, the rover is at a waypoint visible to the lander (i.e., visible from the lander). The visible relations are symmetrical: visible waypointX waypointY. So we need to ensure that at the time of communication, the rover is at a waypoint that is visible to the lander at waypoint2. Let's check visible pairs: visible waypoint2 to waypoint6, visible waypoint6 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint4, visible waypoint4 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint7, visible waypoint7 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint10, visible waypoint10 to waypoint2, visible waypoint2 to waypoint11, visible waypoint11 to waypoint2. So the lander at waypoint2 can see waypoints 6,4,7,10,11. So the rover must be at one of those to communicate.

We need to communicate rock data for waypoint7 and waypoint11. So we need to have have_rock_analysis at those waypoints. That requires sample_rock action at those waypoints. The sample_rock action requires at rover at that waypoint, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of rover0store rover0, empty store. So we need to sample rock at waypoint7 and waypoint11. Then communicate rock data to lander.

Also need to communicate image data for objective0 high_res and objective3 colour. That requires have_image at those objectives with those modes. That requires calibrate camera, then take_image. The camera0 is calibration_target objective0, supports high_res. camera1 is calibration_target objective2 supports colour. camera2 is calibration_target objective1 supports colour

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They have equipment: rover0 has equipped_for_rock_analysis, imaging; rover1 has equipped_for_soil_analysis, imaging. They each have stores.

We need to plan actions: navigate, sample, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate.

We need to ensure that at each step preconditions hold.

We also have constraint: never both rovers at waypoint8 simultaneously. They start at waypoint8. So we must move one away before the other moves? Actually constraint: always not (and (at rover0 waypoint8) (at rover1 waypoint8)). So they cannot both be at waypoint8 at same time. They start both at waypoint8. That violates constraint. So we need to adjust: maybe we need to move one rover out of waypoint8 before the other moves. But they start at waypoint8. The constraint is always, so at initial state it's violated. But maybe the constraint is not enforced at initial state? It says always (not (and (at rover0 waypoint8) (at rover1 waypoint8))). So at initial state, both are at waypoint8, violating. So the problem is unsolvable? But maybe the constraint is not enforced at initial state? Usually constraints apply to all states, including initial. So unsolvable. But maybe we can move one rover out before the other moves. But they start both at waypoint8. So we need to move one rover away first. But we cannot because they both start at waypoint8. But we can move one rover to another waypoint, then the other can stay. But the constraint says at any time, they cannot both be at waypoint8. So we can move rover0 to waypoint1, for example. Then rover1 stays at waypoint8. That satisfies constraint. Then we can move rover1 to other waypoints. So plan

But maybe we can move one rover out before the other moves. But they start both at waypoint8. So we need to move one rover away first. But we cannot because they both start at waypoint8. But we can move one rover to another waypoint, then the other can stay. But the constraint says at any time, they cannot both be at waypoint8. So we can move rover0 to waypoint1, for example. Then rover1 stays at waypoint8. That satisfies constraint. Then we can move rover1 to other waypoints. So plan

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective1 high_res and objective0 high_res. We have cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 supports high_res and low_res. camera1 supports high_res and low_res. camera2 supports colour. But goal requires high_res for objective1 and objective0. So we need to calibrate cameras for those objectives and take images, then communicate image data.

We need to satisfy constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint9) (at rover0 waypoint8). Means rover must visit waypoint9 before waypoint8? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint9 must happen before at rover0 waypoint8. So we must ensure that in plan, we visit waypoint9 before waypoint8.

We start at waypoint11. We need to navigate to waypoint9 then to waypoint8. Also need to capture images for objective1 and objective0. objective1 visible_from waypoint9 and 10 and 11. objective0 visible_from waypoint5,9,11. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the objective. For objective1, we can be at waypoint9,10,11. For objective0, we can be at waypoint5,9,11. So we can take images at waypoint9 for both objectives? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint9, so yes. So we can take image of objective0 at waypoint9. For objective1, visible_from waypoint9 as well. So we can take both images at waypoint9. But we need to calibrate cameras for each objective. We have calibration_target camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective3. So camera0 calibrates for objective0, camera1 for objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 and camera1 at waypoint9. Then take images with each camera. Then communicate image data via lander general at waypoint10? Wait communicate_image_data action requires at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_image, visible, available, channel_free. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to lander. Lander at waypoint10. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint10. Many visible pairs: visible waypoint10 waypoint0,1,3,4,5,8,9, etc. So we can be at waypoint10 to communicate. But we need to satisfy constraint: at rover0 waypoint9 before at rover0 waypoint8. So we can go to waypoint9, then

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,10,11,4; communicated_image_data for objective3 colour and high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint6. Also must satisfy all preconditions.

We need to produce a sequence of actions. We have actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,10,11,4. They are initially at those waypoints: at_soil_sample at waypoint1,2,4,5,7,9,10,11. Wait: at_soil_sample at waypoint1,2,4,5,7,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at waypoint2,10,11,4. So we need to navigate to those waypoints, sample soil, then communicate soil data.

Also need to take images for objective3 with colour and high_res. objective3 visible_from many waypoints: 1,2,4,5,6,9,11. We need to calibrate camera for objective3? The calibration_target for camera0 is objective2, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. None for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective3. But we can still take image? The action take_image requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera for objective3. But we don't have calibration_target for objective3. So maybe we cannot take image for objective3. But the goal requires communicated_image_data objective3 colour and high_res. That means we need to take image and communicate. But we cannot calibrate for objective3. Wait maybe we can calibrate any camera for any objective? The calibration_target predicate indicates which objective a camera is calibrated for. For camera0, target is objective2; camera1 target objective1; camera2 target objective2. So no camera for objective3. So we cannot calibrate for objective3. But maybe we can still take image if we calibrate camera for objective3? The precondition for calibrate action: (calibration_target ?i ?t). So we cannot calibrate for objective3. So we cannot take image for objective3. But the goal requires communicated_image_data objective3 colour and high

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_rock_data waypoint3, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must be at waypoint4 before it is at waypoint2. So order: at waypoint4 before at waypoint2. Also we must ensure that the plan steps satisfy preconditions.

We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint4. So at start, at waypoint4. So constraint satisfied: at waypoint4 before at waypoint2? Wait constraint says sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means at some point, rover0 at waypoint4 must occur before at some point rover0 at waypoint2. Since initial state is at waypoint4, that condition is satisfied. So we don't need to enforce anything else.

Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_soil_data waypoint5, communicated_rock_data waypoint3, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2 and waypoint5, rock sample at waypoint3, and image data for objective1 high_res.

We have sample_soil action requires at_soil_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store empty, etc. We have store rover0store empty initially. So we can sample soil at waypoint2 and waypoint5. But we need to be at those waypoints. We start at waypoint4. We can navigate to waypoint2, 5, 3. We need to navigate to each waypoint.

We also need to have have_soil_analysis at those waypoints to communicate. Then communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at some other waypoint, have_soil_analysis at that waypoint, visible between them, available rover, channel_free. We have lander general at waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to communicate? Wait: communicate_soil_data requires at ?r ?x, at_lander ?l ?y, have_soil_analysis ?r ?p, visible ?x ?y, available ?r, channel_free ?l. So we need to be at some waypoint x, and lander at y. The lander is at waypoint4. So we need to be at a waypoint visible from waypoint4. Many waypoints visible from 4: 0,2,5,1

We need to satisfy goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint5, communicated_image_data objective1 colour, communicated_image_data objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must be at waypoint5 before at waypoint0? Wait "sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint5) (at rover0 waypoint0)" means that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint5 before it is at waypoint0. So the plan must have rover at waypoint5 before it goes to waypoint0. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint5. So constraint satisfied? The constraint says at some point, at waypoint5 before at waypoint0. Since initial state is at waypoint5, that satisfies. So we don't need to move to waypoint0 after that? But we might need to move to waypoint0 to do something? But we need to communicate data from waypoint5 (rock sample). We need to have have_rock_analysis at waypoint5. Initially at waypoint5 there is at_rock_sample waypoint5. So we need to sample rock at waypoint5. Also we need to have image data for objective1 colour and high_res. For that we need to take images at objective1. objective1 visible_from waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to take image? Wait visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So to take image of objective1, we need to be at waypoint4? Actually visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So if we are at waypoint4, we can take image of objective1. But we need to calibrate camera for objective1. The camera0 calibration target is objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 at some waypoint where objective1 is visible. That is visible_from objective1 waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to calibrate camera0 for objective1. Then we can take image at objective1 with camera0. But we also need to have the camera on board, which is true. We also need to have camera0 equipped for imaging. Yes. So plan: navigate to waypoint4, calibrate camera0 for objective1, take image objective1 high_res and colour. Then communicate image data to lander general. Also need to sample rock at waypoint5, communicate rock data. Also need to sample soil at waypoint1? Not necessary

But we might need to move to waypoint0 to do something? But we need to communicate data from waypoint5 (rock sample). We need to have have_rock_analysis at waypoint5. Initially at waypoint5 there is at_rock_sample waypoint5. So we need to sample rock at waypoint5. Also we need to have image data for objective1 colour and high_res. For that we need to take images at objective1. objective1 visible_from waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to take image? Wait visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So to take image of objective1, we need to be at waypoint4? Actually visible_from objective1 waypoint4 means objective1 is visible from waypoint4. So if we are at waypoint4, we can take image of objective1. But we need to calibrate camera for objective1. The camera0 calibration target is objective1. So we need to calibrate camera0 at some waypoint where objective1 is visible. That is visible_from objective1 waypoint4. So we need to be at waypoint4 to calibrate camera0 for objective1. Then we can take image at objective1 with camera0. But we also need to have the camera on board, which is true. We also need to have camera0 equipped for imaging. Yes. So plan: navigate to waypoint4, calibrate camera0 for objective1, take image objective1 high_res and colour. Then communicate image data to lander general. Also need to sample rock at waypoint5, communicate rock data. Also need to sample soil at waypoint1? Not necessary

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, two stores, multiple waypoints, cameras, objectives, modes. The goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint6, communicated_soil_data waypoint0, communicated_rock_data waypoint8, 7,3,4, and communicated_image_data objective0 colour, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these. We must obey constraints: never both rovers at waypoint0 simultaneously.

We need to consider the initial state: rover0 at waypoint6, rover1 at waypoint9. Both available. They have stores empty. They are equipped for soil, rock, imaging. Cameras on board: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0. Calibration targets: camera0 objective2, camera1 objective1. Supports: camera0 high_res, low_res; camera1 colour.

We need to get soil samples at waypoint6 and waypoint0. At initial state, at_soil_sample at waypoint0 and waypoint6. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. We need to communicate soil data for those waypoints. Also rock samples at 8,7,3,4. At initial state, rock samples at 0,1,3,4,7,8. Wait initial state: at_rock_sample waypoint0,1,3,4,7,8. So we need to sample rock at 8,7,3,4. We need to communicate rock data for those waypoints. Also we need to take images for objectives 0,1,2 with specified modes: objective0 colour, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour. We have cameras: camera0 supports high_res and low_res; camera1 supports colour. So we can take images for objective0 with camera0? Wait objective0 visible_from waypoint1,2,3,4,5,8. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective0. We can take image from any waypoint that is visible_from objective0. We need to calibrate camera0 to objective2 (target). For camera0, calibration_target camera0 objective2. So we can calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that is visible_from objective2. Visible_from objective2 includes waypoint0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9. So we can calibrate camera0 at any of those. Then we can take image for

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated soil data for waypoint0 and waypoint10, communicated rock data for waypoint0,10,2,11, and communicated image data for objective2 low_res and objective1 low_res. We have two rovers, rover0 and rover1. They can traverse between waypoints. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They can sample soil/rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data. We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.

We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint9 simultaneously, and never both at waypoint0 simultaneously.

We need to produce a plan that respects these constraints.

We need to consider initial state: rover0 at waypoint7, rover1 at waypoint5. They can traverse to other waypoints via can_traverse edges. They can sample soil/rock at waypoints that have samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint10. The lander is at waypoint10. The lander is channel_free initially. They can communicate data from rover to lander if visible and channel_free.

We need to achieve communicated data for waypoint0 and 10 for soil, rock, etc. Let's analyze.

Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint0, communicated_soil_data waypoint10, communicated_rock_data waypoint0,10,2,11, communicated_image_data objective2 low_res, objective1 low_res.

We need to produce a plan that collects soil and rock samples at those waypoints, then communicate them.

We also need to take images for objective2 low_res and objective1 low_res. The images must be taken by a rover at a waypoint that is visible from the objective. For objective2, visible_from objective2 includes waypoint1,3,4,9,10,11. For objective1, visible_from objective1 includes waypoint0,1,4,9. So we need to take images at those waypoints.

We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. The calibrate action requires that the camera is on board, calibration_target matches objective, at a waypoint visible from objective, and the rover is at that waypoint. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective3? Wait camera0 calibration_target is objective3. But we need images for objective2 and objective1. We have camera1 calibration_target objective0, camera2 calibration_target objective3. None of the cameras are calibration_target for objective2 or objective1. So we cannot

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint9,7,11,2; communicated_rock_data for waypoint10,9,11; communicated_image_data for objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. Rover0 has soil analysis equipment, rover1 has soil, rock, imaging. Rover0 store empty, rover1 store empty. They can traverse many waypoints.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 9,7,11,2. They are at those waypoints initially. We need to sample soil and communicate data. For each sample, we need to have have_soil_analysis after sample. Then communicate_soil_data action requires have_soil_analysis and visible from lander. Lander general at waypoint1. So we need to get rover to waypoint1? Wait visible_from objective0 etc. But for communicate_soil_data, preconditions: at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_soil_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to lander. Lander at waypoint1. So we need to be at a waypoint visible to waypoint1. Many waypoints visible to waypoint1: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. So we can be at any of those. So we can sample soil at waypoint9,7,11,2. Then communicate.

Similarly rock data for waypoint10,9,11. We need have_rock_analysis at those waypoints. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints. We have rock samples at 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11. So we can sample rock at 10,9,11.

Also need image data for objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res. We need to take images at those objectives with appropriate camera and mode. We have cameras 0,1,2 with supports. Camera0 supports high_res and low_res. Camera1 supports high_res and low_res. Camera2 supports colour, high_res. We need objective2 high_res and objective3 low_res. We need to calibrate camera to objective. For objective2, calibration_target camera2 objective2. For objective3, calibration_target camera0 objective3. So we need

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint2 and communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint3) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must visit waypoint3 before waypoint4? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint3 must happen before at rover0 waypoint4. So sequence must have at3 before at4.

We need to get rock data at waypoint2. There is at_rock_sample waypoint2 initially. To communicate rock data, we need have_rock_analysis at that waypoint. So we need to sample rock at waypoint2. But sample_rock action requires at rover at waypoint2, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of store empty. We have store rover0store empty. So we need to navigate to waypoint2, sample rock, then communicate rock data via lander general at some waypoint that is visible from rover's current location. The communicate_rock_data action requires at rover at x, at_lander at y, have_rock_analysis at p, visible x y, available rover, channel_free. After communicating, channel_free toggles? The effect sets channel_free? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: not channel_free then channel_free? Actually effect sets not channel_free then channel_free? That is weird. But we can ignore.

We also need to communicate image data objective0 low_res. That requires have_image at rover at some waypoint, visible from that waypoint to lander, etc. We need to take image of objective0 low_res. objective0 visible_from waypoint0,2,3. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see objective0. We can take image at waypoint0,2,3. We need to calibrate camera0 for low_res mode. camera0 supports low_res. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0? Wait calibrate action requires at rover w, visible_from t w, on_board camera, calibration_target camera0 objective1. So calibration target is objective1, not objective0. So we cannot calibrate for objective0. But we can still take image of objective0 low_res without calibration? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera0 for objective1? But we need image of objective0. The calibration_target is objective1

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,5; communicated_rock_data for waypoint3,4,8,9; communicated_image_data for objective0 low_res, objective1 low_res, objective3 high_res. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint1 or waypoint3 simultaneously.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint6 respectively. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They have stores empty. They can traverse between waypoints as defined.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,5,7. Rock samples at 3,4,7,8,9. But goal only requires communicated data for some of them: soil at 2,5; rock at 3,4,8,9. Also need images for objectives 0,1,3.

We must ensure that after sampling, we have data to communicate. For soil data, we need have_soil_analysis at waypoint. For rock data, have_rock_analysis. For image data, have_image.

Parsed plan:
analysisWe need to produce a valid plan for the given problem.

Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint1 or waypoint3 simultaneously.
We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint6 respectively. They have equipment for soil, rock, imaging. They have stores empty. They can traverse between waypoints as defined.
We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,5,7. Rock samples at 3,4,7,8,9. But goal only requires communicated data for some of them: soil at 2,5; rock at 3,4,8,9. Also need images for objectives 0,1,3.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint4, 9; communicated_rock_data waypoint11,0,2,8; communicated_image_data objective1 colour, objective3 low_res, objective2 high_res. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint0 initially, rover1 at waypoint6. They can traverse along edges defined. We need to collect soil samples at waypoint0,4,6,8,9? Wait soil samples at 0,4,6,8,9. Rock samples at 0,2,4,5,8,9,11. We need to communicate data for rock samples at 0,2,8,11. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints and communicate.

Also need to communicate soil data at 4 and 9. So need to sample soil at 4 and 9.

Also need to take images for objectives 1,3,2 with specified modes.

We need to ensure that each action's preconditions hold.

We need to produce a plan. Let's design.

We have two rovers. Let's use rover0 to collect soil at 4 and 9, and rock at 0,2,8,11. Rover1 can also help.

But we need to ensure that we don't violate constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 11 simultaneously. Initially rover0 at 0, rover1 at 6. So fine.

We need to navigate rovers to appropriate waypoints.

We need to have each rover equipped for soil, rock, imaging. They are equipped.

We need to have store for each rover: rover0store, rover1store. They are empty initially.

We need to sample soil: sample_soil action requires at rover at waypoint with soil sample, equipped, store empty. After sample, store becomes full, soil analysis recorded, sample removed.

Then we need to communicate data: communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at waypoint, at lander at another waypoint, have_soil_analysis, visible, available, channel_free. Lander general at waypoint1 initially. So we need to navigate rover to a waypoint visible from lander. The visible pairs defined. For example, visible waypoint0 waypoint1, etc. So we can have rover at waypoint0 (where soil sample exists) and lander at waypoint1. They are visible

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint9,8,5,6; communicated_rock_data for waypoint0,6; communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint6 simultaneously.

We have two rovers, each with store. They can sample soil and rock, then communicate. They need to be at waypoints with samples. They can sample at waypoint0,5,6,8,9 etc. Let's analyze.

Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint9,8,5,6. That means each of these waypoints must have have_soil_analysis by a rover, then communicate_soil_data action. Similarly rock data for waypoint0 and 6. Also image data for objective2 colour and high_res. That requires take_image with camera0 or camera1? camera0 supports low_res only. camera1 supports colour and high_res. So to get colour and high_res images of objective2, we need to calibrate camera1 to objective2, then take_image with camera1 at some waypoint visible from objective2. visible_from objective2 includes waypoint2,4,6,7,8. So we can have rover1 at waypoint6 (but constraint prohibits both rovers at waypoint6 simultaneously). But we can have rover1 at waypoint6 to take image. But we need to ensure not both at waypoint6. So we can have rover0 at some other waypoint.

We need to plan actions for each rover.

We need to consider that each rover has store empty initially. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints where sample exists. They can drop to empty store. They can communicate data via communicate actions.

We need to ensure that each rover has the necessary equipment: rover0 has equipped_for_soil_analysis and imaging. rover1 has all three.

We need to ensure that each rover can traverse to required waypoints.

We need to ensure that each rover can communicate via lander general at waypoint5. Lander at waypoint5. So to communicate, the rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander. visible_from? Actually visible is defined between waypoints. The visible predicate indicates visibility between waypoints. For communicate actions, precondition requires visible ?x ?y where ?x is rover's waypoint, ?y is lander's waypoint. So the rover must be at a waypoint visible to the lander at waypoint5. Let's check visible pairs: visible

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint1, communicated_rock_data waypoint2, communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint1). That means at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint2 before it is at waypoint1. So the plan must include a sequence where rover0 visits waypoint2 before waypoint1. Also must satisfy that at the end, the goal holds.

We need to produce a plan that uses actions defined: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint2. So at start, at waypoint2. We need to eventually communicate soil data at waypoint1, rock data at waypoint2, image data objective0 low_res.

We need to sample soil at waypoint1 (since at_soil_sample waypoint1). We need to sample rock at waypoint2 (since at_rock_sample waypoint2). Also we need to take image at objective0 low_res. The image must be taken by rover0 at a waypoint that can see objective0. visible_from objective0 waypoint2 and waypoint5. So we need to be at waypoint2 or waypoint5 to take image. But we also need to calibrate camera0 for objective0. The camera0 is on board, calibration_target camera0 objective0. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint that can see objective0. That is waypoint2 or waypoint5. So we can calibrate at waypoint2. Then take image at waypoint2. Then communicate image data to general lander.

Also we need to communicate soil data at waypoint1. So we need to sample soil at waypoint1, then communicate soil data to general. Similarly for rock data at waypoint2.

We also need to satisfy constraint: at some point, rover0 at waypoint2 before at waypoint1. Since we start at waypoint2, that is satisfied.

We need to produce a plan that uses actions in correct order.

Let's outline plan:

Start: rover0 at waypoint2.

Goal: communicate soil data at waypoint1, rock data at waypoint2, image data objective0 low_res.

We need to sample soil at waypoint1: sample_soil action requires at rover0 at waypoint1, at_soil_sample at waypoint1, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store_of rover0

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint6, communicated_soil_data waypoint9, communicated_rock_data waypoint9, communicated_rock_data waypoint0, communicated_rock_data waypoint7, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective1 low_res.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They can traverse between waypoints. They have stores to store samples. They can sample soil and rock, drop, calibrate cameras, take images, communicate data to lander general.

We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.

We must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 9 simultaneously.

We need to produce a valid plan. We can choose any plan that achieves the goal. Let's design a simple plan.

We need to communicate soil data from waypoint6 and 9. So we need to have rover at those waypoints, have soil analysis, then communicate.

Also rock data from 9,0,7. So need rock analysis at those waypoints.

Also image data for objective0 high_res and objective1 low_res.

We have cameras on each rover: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1. Calibration targets: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective0. So camera0 calibrates for objective1, camera1 for objective0.

We need to take images for objective0 high_res and objective1 low_res. So camera1 must take high_res image of objective0, camera0 must take low_res image of objective1.

We need to ensure visible_from conditions: objective0 visible_from waypoint0,5,6,7. objective1 visible_from waypoint0,2,4,5,9. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the objective.

Also visible_from is used in calibrate and take_image actions: calibrate requires visible_from target and at rover's current waypoint. So we need to be at a waypoint that can see the target objective.

Also take_image requires visible_from objective to waypoint, at rover at that waypoint, and camera on board, calibrated, supports mode, etc.

We also need to ensure that after taking image, the camera is no longer calibrated (calibrated predicate removed). So we need to calibrate before each image.

Also we need to ensure that the camera is on board and supports the mode.

We also need to ensure that the rover has the camera on board: on_board camera0 rover0

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated soil data for waypoint3,9,5,4; communicated rock data for waypoint1,5; communicated image data for objective1 low_res, colour; objective3 colour; objective2 low_res. Also constraints: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint9 simultaneously.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint10 initially, rover1 at waypoint2. They can traverse along edges defined by can_traverse. They can sample soil/rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data.

Goal: need to collect soil samples at waypoint3,9,5,4. But initial at waypoint3 has soil sample, at waypoint9 soil sample, at waypoint5 soil sample, at waypoint4 soil sample. Wait initial states: at_soil_sample waypoint3, at_soil_sample waypoint4, at_soil_sample waypoint5, at_soil_sample waypoint9. So all four soil samples present. We need to communicate soil data for each. That requires have_soil_analysis by a rover at that waypoint. So each rover must sample soil at each waypoint and then communicate.

Similarly rock samples at waypoint1,5,6,7,11. But goal only requires communicated rock data for waypoint1 and 5. So we need to sample rock at those waypoints.

Also need to take images for objectives: objective1 low_res and colour, objective3 colour, objective2 low_res. Each objective has visible_from waypoints. For objective1 visible_from: waypoint1,3,5,6,7,10,11. For objective3 visible_from: waypoint6,9. For objective2 visible_from: 0,1,2,4,6,9,10,11.

We need to take images at those waypoints and communicate image data for each objective-mode pair.

We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective3, camera2 objective2. So each camera must be calibrated for its target objective. Calibration requires at rover at waypoint, visible_from target, on_board camera, etc.

We have cameras on rovers: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover1, camera2 on rover0. So camera0 and camera2 on rover0, camera1 on rover1.

We need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. Then take images at visible waypoints for each objective.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective2 high_res. We have a rover0 at waypoint0 initially. We need to get to a waypoint that can see objective2, then take image with high_res mode, then communicate to lander general. Constraints: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint3). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint6 must happen before at rover0 waypoint3. So we must ensure that in plan, we visit waypoint6 before waypoint3.

Goal: communicated_image_data objective2 high_res. That requires have_image rover0 objective2 high_res, then communicate_image_data action.

We need to have have_image. To get have_image, we need to calibrate camera, then take_image. Calibration requires: equipped_for_imaging rover0, calibration_target camera0 objective0? Wait calibration_target camera0 objective0. But we need to calibrate camera0 for objective0? But we need to take image of objective2. The camera0 is calibration_target objective0. camera1 is calibration_target objective2. So we need to calibrate camera1 for objective2. So we need to calibrate camera1 at a waypoint that can see objective2. The visible_from objective2 includes waypoint1,2,3,5,7. So we need to be at one of those waypoints, with camera1 on board, and visible_from objective2 waypoint. Also we need to be at that waypoint to calibrate camera1. Then take_image with camera1, mode high_res, at that waypoint. Then communicate_image_data to lander general.

We also need to satisfy constraints: at rover0 waypoint6 before at rover0 waypoint3. So we must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3. We can plan path: start at waypoint0, go to waypoint6, then to waypoint3, etc.

We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3? Wait visible_from objective2 includes waypoint3. So we can take image at waypoint3. But we must visit waypoint6 before waypoint3. So we can go: waypoint0 -> waypoint6 -> waypoint3. That satisfies constraint.

We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3. Yes.

We need to ensure that we have visible_from objective2 at waypoint3. So we can calibrate camera1 at waypoint3. But we need to be at waypoint3 to calibrate camera1.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_image_data objective3 low_res, objective0 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint4). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint4? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint6 must happen before at rover0 waypoint4. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover is at waypoint6 before it is at waypoint4. So the sequence must have at waypoint6 earlier than at waypoint4.

We need to produce a plan that achieves the communicated image data for those objectives. The plan must involve calibrating cameras, taking images, communicating image data. We have cameras: camera0 target objective0, supports high_res and low_res. camera1 target objective2, supports high_res and low_res. camera2 target objective1, supports colour, high_res. We need images for objective3 low_res, objective0 low_res, objective0 colour, objective1 high_res. Wait objective3 low_res is not directly supported by any camera? camera0 supports high_res and low_res, camera1 supports high_res and low_res, camera2 supports colour and high_res. None supports low_res for objective3. But we can take image with camera0 or camera1? They support low_res. So we can take image for objective3 low_res using camera0 or camera1. But camera0 target is objective0, camera1 target is objective2. But calibration_target indicates which camera is used for which objective. But calibration_target is a predicate that indicates that camera i is calibration target for objective t. But calibration action requires that calibration_target camera i objective t. So camera0 can only calibrate objective0, camera1 objective2, camera2 objective1. So to take image for objective3, we need a camera that supports objective3? None. But maybe we can use camera0 or camera1 to take image for objective3? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r) (on_board ?i ?r) (equipped_for_imaging ?r) (supports ?i ?m) (visible_from ?o ?p) (at ?r ?p). It doesn't require that camera's calibration_target matches objective. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, then use it to take image for objective3? But the camera supports low_res, so we can take

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data for waypoint8,4,11,0; communicated_image_data for objective0 low_res, objective2 low_res, objective1 colour, objective3 high_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint10). Means rover must visit waypoint4 before waypoint10? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint10). So at some point, rover at waypoint4 before at waypoint10. So we need to ensure that order.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves all goals. We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint4. So at start, at waypoint4. So constraint satisfied: at start at waypoint4 before at waypoint10? But we need to ensure that at some point we visit waypoint10 after that. So we can just go to waypoint10 later.

We need to collect rock samples at waypoint8,4,11,0. They are at those waypoints. We need to sample rock at each waypoint, then communicate rock data to lander general. The communicate action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at waypoint11, have_rock_analysis at that waypoint, visible between rover and lander, available rover, channel_free. After communication, channel_free toggles? The effect: not (available ?r) and not (channel_free ?l) then channel_free ?l again? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: they set channel_free to false then true again? Actually they set not channel_free then channel_free again. So net effect: channel_free remains true. So no effect on channel_free. But they set not available. Then they set available again. So net effect: available remains true. So communication doesn't change anything? But they set not available then available again. So no effect. So we can communicate at any time.

We need to have have_rock_analysis at each waypoint. That requires sample_rock action at that waypoint. sample_rock requires at rover at that waypoint, at_rock_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_rock_analysis, store_of store, empty store. So we need to sample rock at each waypoint. After sampling, store becomes full. Then drop to empty store. Then we can communicate.

We also need to have image data for objectives. For each objective, we

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a complex planning problem with many actions. We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoints 3,5,7,11; communicated_rock_data for 11,7,1,6; communicated_image_data for objective2 low_res, objective3 low_res, objective2 colour.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They have stores. They can traverse between waypoints. They can sample soil or rock, drop, calibrate, take image, communicate data. They need to be at waypoints to sample, then communicate.

We need to satisfy constraints: never both rovers at waypoint7 or 8 simultaneously.

We need to produce a plan that uses available actions.

We need to consider that each rover has a store that can hold one sample. They can sample soil or rock if at sample location and equipped. They can drop to empty store. They can communicate data via lander general at waypoint5. The lander is at waypoint5. The lander must be at waypoint5 to communicate. The lander is at waypoint5. The lander must be channel_free initially. The actions communicate_* require at_lander at some waypoint y, visible from x to y, etc.

We need to ensure that the rover is at the waypoint where sample is located, then sample, then drop to store, then communicate. But the communication action requires that the rover is at some waypoint x, the lander at y, and visible between x and y. The visible relations are given. For example, visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Let's check: visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? In init, visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Actually visible waypoint5 to waypoint7 is not listed. But visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not listed. But visible waypoint5 to waypoint7 is not listed. But visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Wait, visible relations: visible waypoint5 to waypoint7? Not listed. visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not listed. So maybe not visible. But visible waypoint7 to waypoint5? Not present. So cannot communicate from waypoint7 to waypoint5? But we need to communicate data from waypoint7. The lander is at waypoint5. So we need visible from waypoint7 to waypoint5. Not present. So maybe we need to move rover to waypoint5 to communicate. But the sample at waypoint7 is at waypoint7.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_soil_data waypoint1, communicated_image_data objective2 low_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint2 before waypoint6? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint2 must happen before at rover0 waypoint6. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint2 before it is at waypoint6. The initial state: rover0 at waypoint2. So that constraint is satisfied already? Wait constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint2) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means the event of being at waypoint2 must occur before being at waypoint6. Since initial state is at waypoint2, that holds. But we must ensure that we don't visit waypoint6 before waypoint2. Since we start at waypoint2, we can go to other waypoints. But we must not visit waypoint6 before we visited waypoint2. Since we start at waypoint2, it's fine.

Goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint3 and waypoint1. That requires we have soil analysis at those waypoints and then communicate. We have soil samples at waypoint1, waypoint3, waypoint4, waypoint6. We need to sample soil at waypoint3 and waypoint1. We have at_soil_sample at waypoint1 and waypoint3. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints. We also need to communicate soil data for those waypoints. We also need to communicate image data for objective2 low_res. That requires we have image data for objective2 low_res. We need to take image at objective2 with low_res mode. We have camera0 supports colour and low_res. camera0 calibration target objective2. So we need to calibrate camera0 at a waypoint visible from objective2. We have visible_from objective2 waypoint1,2,3,4,5,6. So we can calibrate at any of those waypoints. We need to be at a waypoint that is visible from objective2. We can calibrate at waypoint1 or 2 etc. Then take image at objective2 low_res. Then communicate image data.

We also need to communicate soil data for waypoint3 and waypoint1. For that we need to have soil analysis at those waypoints. We can sample soil at those waypoints. We also need to communicate soil data via a lander. The lander is at

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint9, waypoint1, communicated_rock_data waypoint10,7,11, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res, objective1 colour, objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: never both rover0 and rover1 at waypoint7 simultaneously.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint1 initially, rover1 at waypoint7 initially. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints with samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint3. They can take images and communicate image data.

We need to plan actions for each rover to collect data and communicate.

We need to ensure that at no point both rovers are at waypoint7 simultaneously. Initially rover1 is at waypoint7, rover0 at waypoint1. So we must avoid moving rover0 to waypoint7 while rover1 remains there. We can move rover0 away from waypoint7 before moving rover1 away.

Goal: communicate soil data for waypoint9 and waypoint1. Soil samples at waypoint1,4,5,6,7,9,10. So we need to sample soil at waypoint1 and 9. For soil sample at waypoint1: already at waypoint1 initially. So rover0 can sample soil at waypoint1. For soil sample at waypoint9: need to reach waypoint9. We can move rover0 to waypoint9 via traversals. Path: waypoint1 -> waypoint3? Actually visible edges: visible waypoint1 to waypoint3, etc. But can_traverse edges: we have can_traverse for rover0: waypoint1 to 0,2,3,6,8,9,10. So from waypoint1 to waypoint9 is possible via can_traverse? There is can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9? Yes, can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint9. So rover0 can go directly to waypoint9. So we can sample soil at waypoint9.

Similarly rock samples at waypoint10,7,11. We need to sample rock at those waypoints. For rock sample at waypoint10: can_traverse rover0 to waypoint10. For rock sample at waypoint7: can_traverse rover0 to waypoint7? There is can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 to 7? Actually can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 to 7? Not listed. But can_traverse rover0

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint2, communicated_rock_data waypoint10, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res, communicated_image_data objective3 low_res. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6). Means rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint6? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint6). So at some point, rover0 must be at waypoint1 before it is at waypoint6. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint1 before it reaches waypoint6. It doesn't require that it visits both; but must satisfy that at some point, at waypoint1 occurs before at waypoint6. So we need to schedule visits accordingly.

We need to achieve communicated_rock_data for waypoint2 and waypoint10. That requires having rock analysis at those waypoints, then communicating. Also need communicated_image_data for objective0 high_res and objective3 low_res. That requires having images for those objectives with respective modes.

We have cameras: camera0 supports low_res, camera1 supports high_res, camera2 supports high_res and low_res. Calibration targets: camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So to take image for objective0, we need a camera that supports high_res? Wait objective0 visible_from includes waypoint0,1,2,4,7,8. So to take image for objective0 high_res, we need a camera that supports high_res. camera1 supports high_res, camera2 supports high_res. So we can use camera1 or camera2. But camera1 calibration target is objective1, not objective0. Calibration target indicates which objective the camera is calibrated for. But calibration action calibrates camera for a target objective. So to take image for objective0, we need to calibrate camera for objective0. But we only have calibration_target for camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective2. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective0. Wait maybe calibration_target indicates that camera can be calibrated for that objective. But we only have those three. So we cannot calibrate for objective0. But maybe we can calibrate for objective1 and then take image for objective0? That seems wrong. The calibration action requires calibration_target ?i ?t. So only cameras with calibration_target for objective0 can be calibrated. None. So maybe we cannot take image for

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must produce a sequence of actions that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint10, communicated_soil_data waypoint3, communicated_rock_data waypoint0,6,7, communicated_image_data objective0 colour, objective3 colour. Also must satisfy constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0 or 5 simultaneously.

We need to plan actions: navigate, sample, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate data. We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. They start at waypoint5 and waypoint7 respectively. They have stores. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil/rock at waypoints where samples exist. They can drop to store. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint11. The lander is at waypoint11. The lander is channel_free initially. The goal requires communicated data at waypoint10,3,0,6,7, and images for objective0 and 3.

We need to produce plan steps. We must ensure that at each step, preconditions hold. We must also ensure that after each action, state updates accordingly.

We need to produce a plan that uses the actions defined. Let's analyze the initial state.

Initial state:

- visible relations: many pairs. We need to know which waypoints are visible to each other. For navigation, we need can_traverse edges for rover0 and rover1. For rover0: edges between 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10, 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10, 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5-10. Also 5-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-6, 5

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem.

We need to plan actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint7. We need to get soil samples at waypoint5 and 4. They are at waypoint5 and 4. We need to sample soil at those waypoints.

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. This is a planning problem with two rovers, multiple waypoints, samples, etc. The goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint11, waypoint10, waypoint6; communicated_rock_data for waypoint11, waypoint4; communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and objective0 colour.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these goals while respecting constraints: never both rovers at same waypoint 0,2,1 simultaneously. Also must satisfy preconditions.

We need to produce a plan that uses actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have two rovers: rover0 and rover1. Rover0 has equipment for soil and rock analysis. Rover1 has equipment for rock analysis and imaging. Rover0 has store rover0store, empty initially. Rover1 has store rover1store, empty.

We need to collect soil samples at waypoint3,6,10,11? Wait initial state: at_soil_sample at waypoint3,6,10,11. Also at_rock_sample at waypoint0,3,4,7,8,9,10,11. So we need to collect soil samples at 3,6,10,11. But goal only requires communicated_soil_data for waypoint11,10,6. So we need to sample soil at those waypoints and communicate.

Also need rock data for waypoint11 and 4. So need to sample rock at those waypoints.

Also need images for objective2 colour and objective0 colour. Objective0 visible_from at waypoint0,2,3,4,6,8,9. Objective2 visible_from at 1,6,7,9. So we need to take images at those waypoints.

We need to calibrate cameras for each objective. Cameras: camera0, camera1, camera2. camera0 calibration target objective0, supports high_res. camera1 target objective2, supports colour and high_res. camera2 target objective0, supports colour and low_res.

We need to take images for objective0 colour and objective2 colour. So we need to use camera1 for objective2 colour? Wait camera1 supports colour and high_res. So yes, camera1 can take colour images. For objective0 colour, we need camera2 (supports colour). So we need to calibrate camera2 for objective0,

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint4, communicated_soil_data waypoint2, communicated_image_data objective2 colour, communicated_image_data objective1 colour. Also constraint: always (not (at rover1 waypoint5)). So rover1 must never be at waypoint5.

We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint2 initially, rover1 at waypoint8. They can traverse between waypoints as per can_traverse edges. They can sample soil or rock at waypoints with samples. They can communicate data to lander general at waypoint0. Lander at waypoint0. They can communicate soil data from a rover at a waypoint to lander if visible and channel free. The goal requires communicated_soil_data at waypoint4 and waypoint2. So we need to have rover(s) at those waypoints, have soil analysis, then communicate.

Also need communicated_image_data for objective2 colour and objective1 colour. That requires have_image at those objectives with mode colour. The image data is communicated to lander general. So we need to take images at those objectives with camera that supports colour mode. Cameras: camera0 supports colour, camera1 supports high_res and low_res, camera2 supports colour. On board: camera0 on rover0, camera1 on rover0, camera2 on rover1. So we can use camera0 or camera2 for colour.

We need to calibrate camera to objective. Calibration requires at waypoint, visible_from objective, on_board camera, calibration_target. For camera0, calibration_target is objective0. For camera2, calibration_target is objective0. So only objective0 is calibration target. But we need images for objective1 and objective2. Wait: The calibration_target predicate indicates which camera can calibrate which objective. For camera0 and camera2, target is objective0. So they cannot calibrate objective1 or objective2. But we can still take images? The take_image action requires calibrated camera. So we need to calibrate camera to objective. But if camera cannot calibrate objective1 or 2, we cannot take images for those objectives. But maybe we can use camera1? camera1 supports high_res and low_res, but its calibration_target? Not defined. So maybe camera1 cannot calibrate any objective. But the action calibrate requires calibration_target camera i t. So only camera0 and camera2 can calibrate objective0. So we cannot take images for objective1 or 2 with these cameras. But the goal requires communicated

### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We need to satisfy goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint2,9,6,4; communicated_image_data for objective1 low_res and objective0 low_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint1) (at rover0 waypoint7). So rover must visit waypoint1 before waypoint7.

We need to produce a sequence of actions that achieves these goals. We must consider actions: navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, communicate_image_data.

We have initial state: rover0 at waypoint0. There are visible relations between waypoints. We need to traverse to waypoints with samples: waypoint2,6,4,9. They have at_soil_sample or at_rock_sample. For soil samples: waypoint2,4,5,6,8,9. For rock samples: waypoint0,4,6,7,8,9,10. We need to collect soil samples at waypoint2,6,4. For each, we need to sample soil (sample_soil action). That requires at_soil_sample at that waypoint, equipped_for_soil_analysis, store empty, etc. After sampling, we need to communicate soil data to lander general. The communicate_soil_data action requires at rover at some waypoint, at_lander at some waypoint, have_soil_analysis, visible, available, channel_free. After communicating, the channel_free toggles? The effect: not (available ?r) then not (channel_free ?l) then channel_free ?l? Wait effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). That seems contradictory: first not channel_free, then channel_free. So net effect: channel_free remains true? Actually effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). So channel_free is set to true again. So channel_free remains true. So we can communicate multiple times.

We need to ensure that after each communicate, the rover becomes unavailable? Actually available toggles: initially available rover0. After communicate, available becomes false, then set back to true. So fine.

We need to ensure that we have soil analysis at each waypoint. So we need to sample soil at each waypoint. For each sample, we need to have store empty. After sample, store becomes full. Then drop

That seems contradictory: first not channel_free, then channel_free. So net effect: channel_free remains true? Actually effect: (not (available ?r))(not (channel_free ?l))(channel_free ?l). So channel_free is set to true again. So channel_free remains true. So we can communicate multiple times.
We need to ensure that after each communicate, the rover becomes unavailable? Actually available toggles: initially available rover0. After communicate, available becomes false, then set back to true. So fine.
We need to ensure that we have soil analysis at each waypoint. So we need to sample soil at each waypoint. For each sample, we need to have store empty. After sample, store becomes full. Then drop

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan for the given problem. We must satisfy goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint6, communicated_image_data objective1 low_res, communicated_image_data objective0 high_res. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint7) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must visit waypoint7 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint7 must happen before at rover0 waypoint0. So the plan must ensure that at some point, rover0 is at waypoint7 before it is at waypoint0. Currently initial state: at rover0 waypoint7. So constraint satisfied? Wait constraint says sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint7) (at rover0 waypoint0). That means the action that makes rover at waypoint7 must occur before the action that makes rover at waypoint0. Since initial state is at waypoint7, that condition is satisfied. But we must ensure that we don't violate it by visiting waypoint0 before waypoint7. Since we start at waypoint7, we can go to waypoint0 later. So fine.

Goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint6. That requires have_rock_analysis at waypoint6, and then communicate_rock_data action. We have at_rock_sample at waypoint6 initially. So we need to sample rock at waypoint6. But we need to be at waypoint6, have rock analysis, and then communicate. Also we need to communicate image data for objective1 low_res and objective0 high_res. That requires have_image for those objectives with modes. We need to take images at appropriate waypoints visible to objectives.

We have visible_from objective1 waypoint5. So to take image for objective1, we need to be at waypoint5, have camera on board, calibrated for objective1, and visible_from objective1 waypoint5. Also we need to calibrate camera for objective1. Calibration requires at rover at waypoint, calibration_target camera1 objective1, on_board camera1, visible_from objective1 waypoint5. So we can calibrate at waypoint5. Then take image at waypoint5 with camera1, objective1, low_res. But we need to support low_res. camera1 supports low_res. Good.

Similarly for objective0 high_res: visible_from objective0 waypoint0,3,4,5,7. We can take image at waypoint0 with camera0 high_res. camera0 supports high_res. So we need to be at waypoint0, calibrate camera0 for objective0, then take image.

We also need to sample rock at waypoint

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_rock_data waypoint5 and communicated_image_data objective2 colour. Also must satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means rover must visit waypoint6 before waypoint0? Actually constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint6) (at rover0 waypoint0). Means at some point, rover0 at waypoint6 must occur before at some point rover0 at waypoint0. So we need to ensure that at some point we visit waypoint6 before we visit waypoint0. Currently initial state: rover0 at waypoint2. So we need to plan a sequence that visits waypoint6 before waypoint0. Also we need to communicate rock data at waypoint5 and image data objective2 colour. We have to sample rock at waypoint5? Actually at_rock_sample waypoint5 is true initially. So we need to sample rock at waypoint5, then communicate rock data. Also we need to take image of objective2 with colour mode. We need to calibrate camera0 or camera1? We have camera0 supports colour, high_res. camera1 supports colour, low_res. We need to take image with colour mode. So we need to calibrate camera0 or camera1 for objective2. We have calibration_target camera0 objective1, camera1 objective1. So cameras are calibrated for objective1 only. But we need to take image of objective2. We can calibrate camera for objective2? The calibrate action requires calibration_target ?i ?t. So we cannot calibrate for objective2 because not defined. But we could use camera that supports colour and take image of objective2. But precondition requires calibrated ?i ?r. So we need to calibrate camera for objective2.

Wait: calibration_target predicate indicates which objective a camera is calibrated for. In init, we have calibration_target camera0 objective1 and camera1 objective1. So only objective1. So we cannot calibrate for objective2. But maybe we can take image without calibration? No, precondition requires calibrated. So we need to calibrate for objective2. But we don't have that.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves goal: communicated_image_data objective0 low_res. We have to satisfy constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint4) (at rover0 waypoint7). Means rover must visit waypoint4 before waypoint7? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint4 must happen before at rover0 waypoint7. So we need to ensure that in plan, the rover visits waypoint4 before waypoint7. Also we need to eventually communicate image data for objective0 low_res. That requires have_image rover0 objective0 low_res, and then communicate_image_data action.

We need to get have_image. To get have_image, we need to calibrate camera, then take_image. The camera must be on board, calibrated, supports low_res, visible_from objective0 at some waypoint where rover is. The visible_from objective0 includes waypoint1,4,7. So we need to be at a waypoint that is visible from objective0. Also we need to have visible_from objective0 at that waypoint. The visible_from predicate is defined for objective0 at waypoint1,4,7. So we need to be at one of those waypoints. Also we need to have visible_from objective0 at that waypoint. The visible_from predicate is static; we don't need to satisfy visible? Wait visible_from is a predicate that indicates that objective0 can see that waypoint. So we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. So we can be at waypoint4 or 1 or 7. But we also need to satisfy constraint: at rover0 waypoint4 before at rover0 waypoint7. So we can go to waypoint4 first, then to waypoint7. But we need to be at a waypoint that is visible_from objective0. Let's choose waypoint4. So we can navigate to waypoint4, calibrate camera0 (or camera1) for objective0, then take image low_res, then communicate image data.

We also need to ensure that we have the camera calibrated. The calibrate action requires: equipped_for_imaging rover, calibration_target camera i objective t, at rover w, visible_from t w, on_board camera i. So we need to be at a waypoint w that is visible_from objective0. So we can be at waypoint4. visible_from objective0 waypoint4 is true. So calibrate camera0 at waypoint4. Then take_image at waypoint4 with camera0, low_res. Then communicate_image_data at waypoint4 to lander general. But we need to be

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data waypoint9, waypoint4; communicated_rock_data waypoint1,9,4,5; communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res, objective0 colour. Also constraint: sometime-before (at rover0 waypoint0) (at rover0 waypoint2). Means rover must visit waypoint0 before waypoint2? Actually constraint: at rover0 waypoint0 must happen before at rover0 waypoint2. So we must ensure that in plan, the action that moves rover to waypoint0 occurs before the action that moves rover to waypoint2. Also we must satisfy all preconditions.

We need to produce a valid plan. Let's analyze initial state.

Initial state: rover0 at waypoint10. It has all equipment. There are samples at various waypoints: at_rock_sample at 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. at_soil_sample at 3,4,7,9,10. So we need to collect soil samples at waypoint9 and 4. Also rock samples at 1,9,4,5. So we need to sample at those waypoints. Then communicate data to lander general at waypoint0. Lander at waypoint0. So we need to travel to waypoint0 to communicate. But we also need to collect images for objectives 2,3,0. For each objective, we need to calibrate camera and take image. Then communicate image data to lander.

We need to ensure that we have at least one image for each objective. The goal requires communicated_image_data objective2 high_res, objective3 low_res, objective0 colour. So we need to take images with those modes.

We have cameras: camera0 supports colour, high_res. calibration_target camera0 objective3. camera1 supports colour, high_res, low_res. calibration_target camera1 objective0. camera2 supports colour, high_res, low_res. calibration_target camera2 objective2.

Thus we need to calibrate each camera for its target objective. For objective3, camera0. For objective0, camera1. For objective2, camera2.

We need to take images at visible_from positions for each objective. For objective0 visible_from includes waypoint0,1,2,4,8,9,10,11. For objective1 visible_from includes 1,5,6,8,10. For objective2 visible_from includes 4,5,7

But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The precondition for take_image: (calibrated ?i ?r). So camera must be calibrated for that rover. Calibration target is camera0 objective0, camera1 objective1, camera2 objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. So maybe we can take image for objective2 with any camera that supports the mode? Wait the action take_image requires (calibrated ?i ?r) and (supports ?i ?m). So camera must be calibrated for that rover, but not necessarily for the objective. The calibration target is just a property of camera. But the calibration target is used in calibrate action: precondition includes (calibration_target ?i ?t). So to calibrate camera i for rover r, we need to specify a target objective t. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, camera1 for objective1, camera2 for objective0. So we cannot calibrate camera for objective2. But maybe we can calibrate camera for objective0 and then take image for objective2? The action take_image doesn't require that the objective matches the calibration target. It only requires that the camera is calibrated for that rover. So we can calibrate camera0 for objective0, then take image for objective2 with camera0. That seems allowed. So we

### Output Requirements:
- Return ONLY the plan steps, one per line.
- Each line must follow the format:
  (<ACTION_NAME> <param1> <param2> ...)
- Use only objects defined in the PROBLEM.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or headers.
- Do NOT output anything except the plan lines.
- The output must NOT contain natural language sentences.
- If the PROBLEM includes PDDL3 constraints, the plan must satisfy all of them; otherwise, solve as a standard PDDL2 goal-directed task.
- Ensure that all action preconditions hold and no constraints or invariants are violated at any step.
### Plan:
"""
<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a valid plan that achieves the goal: communicated_soil_data for waypoint8, 11, 0, 6; communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. Also constraint: always (not (at rover1 waypoint8)). So rover1 must never be at waypoint8. We have two rovers: rover0 at waypoint3 initially, rover1 at waypoint9. We have visible relations, can_traverse edges. We need to collect soil samples at waypoints 8, 11, 0, 6. They are at those waypoints initially: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Wait list: at_soil_sample waypoint0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Also at_rock_sample at 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11. So we need to sample soil at 8, 11, 0, 6. We have store for each rover. They start empty. We need to sample soil at each waypoint, then communicate soil data to lander general at waypoint2. The lander is at waypoint2. We need to have rover at waypoint2 to communicate. But we have to ensure that rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. But rover0 can traverse to waypoint8? Let's check can_traverse edges: rover0 can traverse to waypoint8 from 3, and from 8 to 4, 10. Also from 3 to 9, 11. So to reach waypoint8, rover0 must go from 3 to 8. That's allowed. So we can use rover0 to sample at 8. For other waypoints 0,6,11, we can use rover0 or rover1. But we must ensure rover1 never at waypoint8. So we can avoid that.

Goal also requires communicated_image_data for objective3 low_res, high_res, objective2 low_res. We need to take images at those objectives. We have cameras on rovers: camera0,1,2 on rover0; camera3 on rover1. Each camera has calibration_target: camera0 -> objective1, camera1 -> objective2, camera2 -> objective2, camera3 -> objective1. They support modes: camera0 supports colour, high_res; camera1 supports low_res; camera
